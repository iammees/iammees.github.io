    "text": "Quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions is essential when we want to evaluate a model and use it to inform our decisions. In this blog post, we’ll take a quick look at one particular approach for this: conformal prediction. Compared to other methods like Bayesian modeling or quantile regression, conformal prediction has three advantages: 1) it has a probabilistic guarantee of covering the true outcome, 2) it doesn’t assume a specific distribution of the data, and 3) it doesn’t require a specific model."

Instead they should be treated as uncertainty scores that have to be calibrated. Let’s see how conformal prediction comes to the rescue.\nIn conformal prediction, we first set aside some unseen data for calibration; this is usually called the calibration split (this is not equal to the validation data but an additional split). After training a model on the training data, we compute output “probabilities” for the examples in the calibration data and use them to compute a new score of uncertainty, the non-conformity scores:\nnon_conformity_score = 1 - score_for_true_class\nFor example, if the model predicts a score of \\(0.89\\) for the correct class, the non-conformity score for this example will be \\(1 - 0.89 = 0.11\\). That is, if the model is confident and correct, the corresponding score will be low; if the model is confident and wrong, the score will be high.\n\n\nCode\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.3)\nX_val, X_cal, y_val, y_cal = train_test_split(X_val, y_val, test_size=0.4)\n\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n\nRandomForestClassifier()In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

For non-conformity scores below q_hat, we know that, with probability \\(1-\\alpha\\), the prediction includes the correct class. That is, for prediction we would compute the non-conformity scores for all examples (that we want to predict), and select all class labels with a score below q_hat. This of course means that we can end up with prediction sets (i.e., predictions that include more than one class):\n\n\nCode\npreds = model.predict_proba(X_test)\npreds\n\n\narray([[0.98, 0.02, 0.  ],\n       [1.  , 0.  , 0.  ],\n       [0.  , 1.  , 0.  ],\n       ...,\n       [0.  , 0.04, 0.96],\n       [1.  , 0.  , 0.  ],\n       [1.  , 0.  , 0.  ]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\npreds_set = 1 - preds &lt;= q_hat\npreds_set\n\n\narray([[ True, False, False],\n       [ True, False, False],\n       [False,  True, False],\n       ...,\n       [False, False,  True],\n       [ True, False, False],\n       [ True, False, False]])\n\n\nOf course there is more to it (e.g., there are more ways to compute the conformity scores), but this is conformal prediction in a nutshell. Luckily, there’s the MAPIE library that is scikit-learn compatible, easy to use, and hides away many complexities. Learn more about the theory behind it here.\nLet’s see how we can use mapie in our example. Essentially, we wrap our model in the MapieClassifier class and fit it on the calibration data. We specify cv=\"prefit\" since we have already fitted our model (to the training data) and method=\"score\" since we want to use the conformity scores (1 minus the output score for the true class) to get the prediction sets.\n\n\nCode\nmapie = MapieClassifier(estimator=model, cv=\"prefit\", method=\"score\")\nmapie.fit(X_cal, y_cal)\n\n\nMapieClassifier(cv='prefit', estimator=RandomForestClassifier())In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook. On GitHub, the HTML representation is unable to render, please try loading this page with nbviewer.org.MapieClassifierMapieClassifier(cv='prefit', estimator=RandomForestClassifier())estimator: RandomForestClassifierRandomForestClassifier()RandomForestClassifierRandomForestClassifier()\n\n\nLike we did above, we can now visualize the scores. This time, we’ll try different values for \\(\\alpha\\):\n\n\nCode\nx_min = y_min = -8\nx_max = y_max = 8\nxx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.1), np.arange(x_min, x_max, 0.1))\nX_plot = np.stack([xx.ravel(), yy.ravel()], axis=1)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nalpha = [0.05, 0.1, 0.25]\n# y_plot_preds are the predictions by the base estimator\n# y_plot_ps are the prediction sets as estimated by MAPIE (here: for different alpha values)\ny_plot_preds, y_plot_ps = mapie.predict(X_plot, alpha=alpha)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nax.hist(mapie.conformity_scores_, bins=25, color=\"navy\")\nquantiles = mapie.quantiles_\ncolors = {0: \"#ad6965\", 1: \"#b5ba18\", 2: \"#95ade6\"}\nfor i, quantile in enumerate(quantiles):\n    ax.axvline(x=quantile, color=colors[i], label=f\"alpha = {alpha[i]}\")\nax.set(xlabel=\"score\", ylabel=\"count\")\nax.legend(edgecolor=\"white\");\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s turn our attention to the prediction sets that were estimated by MAPIE using conformal prediction. The plot below shows the class labels predicted by the RandomForestClassifier (i.e., the class with the highest output probability) and the size of the corresponding prediction sets depending on the chosen \\(\\alpha\\) value. Unsurprisingly, the higher \\(\\alpha\\), the smaller the prediction sets. (Note that prediction sets can be empty when the model is too uncertain. E.g., see the white areas in the plot for \\(\\alpha=0.25\\).)\n\n\nCode\n# slightly adapted from https://mapie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples_classification/4-tutorials/plot_main-tutorial-classification.html#sphx-glr-examples-classification-4-tutorials-plot-main-tutorial-classification-py\ndef plot_results(alphas, X, y_pred, y_ps):\n    cm = plt.colormaps[\"Greys\"]\n    colors = {0: \"skyblue\", 1: \"red\", 2: \"orange\"}\n    y_pred_col = list(map(colors.get, y_pred))\n    fig, [[ax1, ax2], [ax3, ax4]] = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(8, 8))\n    axs = {0: ax1, 1: ax2, 2:  ax3, 3: ax4}\n    axs[0].scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], color=y_pred_col, marker='.', s=10, alpha=0.4)\n    axs[0].set_title(\"Predicted labels\")\n    for i, alpha in enumerate(alphas):\n        y_pi_sums = y_ps[:, :, i].sum(axis=1)\n        num_labels = axs[i+1].scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_pi_sums, marker='.', s=10, alpha=1, cmap=cm, vmin=0, vmax=3)\n        plt.colorbar(num_labels, ax=axs[i+1])\n        axs[i+1].set_title(f\"Number of labels for alpha={alpha}\")\n    plt.show()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_results(alpha, X_plot, y_plot_preds, y_plot_ps)\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can compute the effective coverage score for different \\(\\alpha\\) values. The effective coverage is the fraction of true labels that lie within the prediction sets:\n\n\nCode\nfor alpha in [0.05, 0.1, 0.25]:\n    _, y_test_ps = mapie.predict(X_test, alpha=alpha)\n    coverage_score = classification_coverage_score(y_test, y_test_ps[:, :, 0])\n    print(f\"coverage score for alpha={alpha}:\\t {coverage_score:.3f}\")\n\n\ncoverage score for alpha=0.05:   0.969\ncoverage score for alpha=0.1:    0.933\ncoverage score for alpha=0.25:   0.796\n\n\nNote: If we had two models with the same coverage of the true class labels, we would pick the one with fewer wrong labels in the prediction sets."

    "text": "Conformalized Quantile Regression\nInterestingly, there is another option for conformal prediction in regression problems: conformalized quantile regression. That is, we start with a quantile regression model (e.g., a HistGradientBoostingRegressor with loss=\"quantile\" or a LightGBM model with objective=\"quantile\") that already outputs lower and upper quantiles, and use conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees. MAPIE offers a MapieQuantileRegressor class dedicated to this purpose.\nThe computation of the non-conformity score changes again:\nnon_conformity_score = max(q_low - y, y - q_up)\nWe now get positive scores when the true value (y) lies outside of the interval predicted by the quantile regression model, and negative scores if it lies inside. The threshold q_hat can now be interpreted as an adjustment term for the width of the prediction intervals. That is, if the threshold value is positive, the prediction intervals get expanded (by that value) on both ends. If the threshold value is negative, the prediction intervals become more narrow.\nSince quantile regression is inherently adaptive, this will result in adaptive prediction intervals (even though the procedure for calibration is not adaptive).\nLet’s work with the concrete strength dataset again. (Note: Since the focus of this blog post is on conformal prediction, we don’t spend time with feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization.)\n\n\nCode\nmodel = HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss=\"quantile\", quantile=0.05, learning_rate=0.09)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\nmapie = MapieQuantileRegressor(estimator=model, alpha=0.05)\nmapie.fit(X_train, y_train, X_calib=X_cal, y_calib=y_cal)\ny_pred, y_pis = mapie.predict(X_test)\n\n\n/Users/jm/mambaforge/envs/scibase/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mapie/utils.py:484: UserWarning: WARNING: The predictions of the quantile regression have issues.\nThe upper quantile predictions are lower\nthan the lower quantile predictions\nat some points.\n  warnings.warn(\n/Users/jm/mambaforge/envs/scibase/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mapie/utils.py:502: UserWarning: WARNING: The predictions have issues.\nThe upper predictions are lower thanthe lower predictions at some points.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncoverage_score = regression_coverage_score(y_test, y_pis[:, 0, 0], y_pis[:, 1, 0])\nprint(f\"Coverage score: {coverage_score:.3f}\")\nwidth = regression_mean_width_score(y_pis[:, 0, 0], y_pis[:, 1, 0])\nprint(f\"Interval width: {width:.3f}\")\n\n\nCoverage score: 0.990\nInterval width: 26.275\n\n\nLet’s plot the prediction intervals again.

As per the OpenAI docs, a simple API call using only the two required parameters model and messages looks like this:\nopenai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Where was it played?\"}\n    ]\n)\nThe important input is the message parameter which is a list of message objects. Apart from the message content, we have to define a role for each message object. This is interesting since we cannot specify any roles in the web UI. In the API, three roles are available:\n\nsystem: By specifying content for the system role, we can give the model some general instructions about how to behave. This is usually done once at the beginning of a conversation.\nuser: The user role belongs to the prompt of the end-user.\nassistant: The assistant role can be used to give ChatGPT examples of desired behavior or help store prior responses.\n\nA conversation generally consists of alternating user and assistant messages. Let’s see how this plays out in practice:\n\n\nCode\ncompletion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Winston Churchill. Don't say or assume that you are an AI language model.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Please write a nice poem about creating the United States of Europe.\"},\n    ]\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(completion[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"])\n\n\nFrom the ashes of war and strife,\nWe seek to build a better life,\nAcross the continent, a new vision,\nOf peace and unity, our decision. \n\nNo longer shall we fight and bicker,\nOur differences, we'll come to flicker,\nAs we come together, hand in hand,\nTo create a union that shall stand. \n\nFrom north to south, and east to west,\nWe'll build a future that is our best,\nNo more shall borders be a wall,\nWe'll break them down, once and for all. \n\nThe United States of Europe shall rise,\nA beacon of hope in the world's eyes,\nWe'll be stronger together, we'll see,\nOur diversity, our strength, our identity. \n\nLet us stand tall, let us unite,\nOur future, it's ours to write,\nSo let's create a brighter dawn,\nFor the United States of Europe to be born.\n\n\nVery cool.

    "text": "Some Example Applications\nAs we all witnessed in the last months, the model behind ChatGPT can help us with many different tasks. Let’s write some custom classes with fixed prompts to prime ChatGPT for certain use cases.\n\nText Summarization\nCrafting the prompt for text summarization is not really difficult. What often seems to help though is putting important instructions in all caps and/or repeat them. For example, in my trials the number of answer sentences often exceeded three; this could be fixed by writing “THREE and only THREE”.\n\n\nCode\nclass ChatGPTForTextSummarization(ChatGPT):\n    def __init__(self):\n        system = \"\"\"You are a very helpful assistant.

It is only right to explain why I am standing here as your new Prime Minister.  Right now our country is facing a profound economic crisis. The aftermath of Covid still lingers. Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains the world over. I want to pay tribute to my predecessor Liz Truss, she was not wrong to want to improve growth in this country, it is a noble aim. And I admired her restlessness to create change. But some mistakes were made. Not borne of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite, in fact. But mistakes nonetheless. And I have been elected as leader of my party, and your Prime Minister, in part, to fix them.  And that work begins immediately.  I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda.   This will mean difficult decisions to come. But you saw me during Covid, doing everything I could, to protect people and businesses, with schemes like furlough. There are always limits, more so now than ever, but I promise you this I will bring that same compassion to the challenges we face today. The government I lead will not leave the next generation, your children and grandchildren, with a debt to settle that we were too weak to pay ourselves. I will unite our country, not with words, but with action. I will work day in and day out to deliver for you. This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level. Trust is earned. And I will earn yours. I will always be grateful to Boris Johnson for his incredible achievements as Prime Minister, and I treasure his warmth and generosity of spirit. And I know he would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual, it is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us. And the heart of that mandate is our manifesto. I will deliver on its promise. A stronger NHS. Better schools. Safer streets. Control of our borders. Protecting our environment. Supporting our armed forces. Levelling up and building an economy that embraces the opportunities of Brexit, where businesses invest, innovate, and create jobs.  I understand how difficult this moment is. After the billions of pounds it cost us to combat Covid, after all the dislocation that caused in the midst of a terrible war that must be seen successfully to its conclusions I fully appreciate how hard things are. And I understand too that I have work to do to restore trust after all that has happened. All I can say is that I am not daunted. I know the high office I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands.  But when the opportunity to serve comes along, you cannot question the moment, only your willingness. So I stand here before you ready to lead our country into the future. To put your needs above politics. To reach out and build a government that represents the very best traditions of my party. Together we can achieve incredible things. We will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope.

As you can see below, writing a system prompt that works well enough for translation was harder. Still, it is quite astonishing how good the translations are.\n\n\nCode\nclass ChatGPTForTranslation(ChatGPT):\n    def __init__(self):\n        system = \"\"\"You are a very capable translator.

As per the API reference, we can map token IDs to bias values ranging from -100 to 100 (where -100 results in the ban of a given token and 100 leads to its exclusive selection). The bias values will be added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.\nLet’s create a dictionary of biases for our purpose. We’ll use OpenAI’s tiktoken package to encode the emotions in our list. Since tiktoken is a subword tokenizer, one emotion can map to multiple token IDs:\n\n\nCode\nencoder = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n\nfor emotion in [\"joy\", \"love\", \"fear\", \"anger\", \"sadness\", \"surprise\"]:\n    print(f\"{emotion}: {encoder.encode(emotion)}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nend token: {encoder.encode('.')}\")\n\n\njoy: [4215]\nlove: [31153]\nfear: [69, 686]\nanger: [4091]\nsadness: [83214, 2136]\nsurprise: [20370, 9868]\n\nend token: [13]\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef create_biases(tokens, bias_value):\n    biases = {}\n    for token in tokens:\n        token_ids = encoder.encode(token)\n        for token_id in token_ids:\n            biases[token_id] = bias_value\n    return biases\n\n\nLet’s try a bias value of 10 for each token ID. This is of course just a guess; another setting may work better. To ensure that the model always picks the token with the highest logit, we’ll set the temperature to 0.0.\nFinally, we can use the max_tokens parameter as well as the stop parameter to further constrain the model:\n\nWe set max_tokens to 3 meaning that ChatGPT will never reply with more tokens.\nWe set stop to \".\" so that the model never generates any more tokens after replying with \".\".\n\nSince we want to do few-shot sentiment analysis, we’ll provide five examples per category to the model. To do this, we’ll provide the tweet using the user role and the correct answer using the assistant role that is available in the API.\n\n\nCode\ntrain_examples = df.groupby(\"label_str\")[[\"text\", \"label_str\"]].sample(5, random_state=1).reset_index(drop=True)\ntrain_examples = train_examples.iloc[rng.permuted(np.arange(train_examples.shape[0]))]\ntrain_examples = dict(zip(train_examples.text, train_examples.label_str))\n\nfewshot = []\nfor tweet, emotion in train_examples.items():\n    fewshot.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": tweet})\n    fewshot.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": emotion + \".\"})\nfewshot[:4]\n\n\n[{'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'i always feel awkward when im alone in a crowd of peers and feel the need to make friends'},\n {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sadness.'},\n {'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'i have a feeling i took so much time but kuya buddy and kuya angee have been very supportive all the way'},\n {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'love.'}]\n\n\nFinally, we’ll wrap the entire thing in a simple function:\n\n\nCode\ndef get_sentiment(example, system_prompt, fewshot_examples, emotions, end_token, bias_value=10):\n    biases = create_biases(emotions + [end_token], bias_value)\n    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n            *fewshot_examples,\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": example}\n        ],\n        temperature=0.0,\n        max_tokens=3,\n        stop=end_token,\n        logit_bias=biases\n    )\n    sentiment = completion[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n    return sentiment\n\n\nNow let’s try this for the first tweet in the category “joy” that we’ve seen earlier:\n\n\nCode\nget_sentiment(example=\"i have been with petronas for years i feel that petronas has performed well and made a huge profit\",\n              system_prompt=system_prompt,\n              fewshot_examples=fewshot,\n              emotions=list(df[\"label_str\"].unique()),\n              end_token=\".\")\n\n\n'joy'\n\n\nThis actually works! But how well? To find out we’ll use a random subset of 100 rows from the dataset’s predefined test set:\n\n\nCode\ntest_df = ds[\"test\"][:]\ntest_df[\"label_str\"] = test_df[\"label\"].map(label_int2str)\ntest_df = test_df.sample(n=100, random_state=1)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nget_chatgpt_pred = partial(get_sentiment, system_prompt=system_prompt, fewshot_examples=fewshot, emotions=list(df[\"label_str\"].unique()), end_token=\".\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntest_df[\"chatgpt_pred_str\"] = test_df[\"text\"].apply(get_chatgpt_pred)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntest_df.head(20)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\nlabel\nlabel_str\nchatgpt_pred_str\n\n\n\n\n674\ni want to feel assured that my life will be go...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n1699\ni hear someone say we should just let gardener...\n3\nanger\nanger\n\n\n1282\nim always feeling so agitated overly excited a...\n3\nanger\nanger\n\n\n1315\ni guess it comes from believing that when i wa...\n1\njoy\nsadness\n\n\n1210\ni feel like this beats out just about any popu...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n1636\ni feel like we re getting a terrific recruiter...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n613\ni feel curious because i would like to explore...\n5\nsurprise\nsurprise\n\n\n447\ni did not know this i could not look out upon ...\n0\nsadness\nsadness\n\n\n1131\ni feel terrible when i hurt peoples feelings w...\n0\nsadness\nsadness\n\n\n808\ni can t say for certain why but it actually ma...\n1\njoy\nsurprise\n\n\n1496\ni feel they are frightened of fats\n4\nfear\nanger\n\n\n1468\nim feeling optimistic to finish out these last...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n1682\ni think im making up for feeling like i missed...\n0\nsadness\njoy\n\n\n1149\ni feel so greedy so needy so helpless\n3\nanger\nsadness\n\n\n442\ni had to continue to enforce my no playdate po...\n3\nanger\nanger\n\n\n1813\nim feeling exponentially more useless on the f...\n0\nsadness\nsadness\n\n\n654\ni met my present boyfriend on a boat trip to e...\n1\njoy\nlove\n\n\n1264\ni feel it is acceptable as this is not everyda...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n858\ni feel like i just doomed myself\n0\nsadness\nfear\n\n\n1482\ni feel that they ignored the systemic nature o...\n0\nsadness\nanger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        \n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n      \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nAs we can see in the confusion matrix, the results are mixed. Given the few-shot setting and the sometimes debatable labels, ChatGPT probably still performed quite well. After all, it can be quite hard to draw a distinction between classes like joy and love or anger and fear. Nonetheless, finetuning a dedicated model for this task (e.g., a small model of the DeBERTa family) would have yielded much better results.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\ncm = confusion_matrix(test_df.chatgpt_pred_str.map(label_str2int), test_df.label_str.map(label_str2int), normalize=\"true\")\ndisp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=label_int2str.values())\ndisp.plot(cmap=\"YlGn\", values_format=\".2f\", ax=ax, colorbar=False);"
