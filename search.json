    "text": "Forecasting, the task of predicting the future, has a vast number of crucially important applications in diverse areas such as medicine, financial decision making, climate modeling, and traffic planning. Consequently, time series modelling has always been an area of intensive research leading to the development of a multitude of different forecasting methods. While traditional approaches are typically model-driven (i.e., they make rather strong assumptions, but don’t require many observations to estimate model parameters), the rise of machine learning has facilitated research into data-driven approaches that require more data but are also much more flexible (see this recent paper for a deeper dive into the characteristics of forecasting methods).\nIn particular, recent research appears to be largely concentrated on deep learning-based forecasting, which has indeed led to many successful innovations. In recent forecasting competitions, however, it became apparent that many teams relied heavily on Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDTs) to achieve top ranks – a finding that underscores the practical relevance and usefulness of tree-based models but doesn’t seem to be reflected yet in the attention of researchers. A recent review article, for example, that aims to provide an extensive overview of the theory and practice of forecasting doesn’t shed much light on the role of tree-based models. Thus, in this blog post we’ll have a look at why and how GBDTs can be effective models for forecasting. In the process, we’ll also have a look at some model agnostic peculiarities of time series that need to be adressed in any forecasting problem.\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.patches import Patch\nfrom sktime.forecasting.model_selection import ExpandingWindowSplitter, SlidingWindowSplitter\nCode\ndef get_ax(figsize=(11, 4), grid=False, title=None, xlabel=None, ylabel=None):\n    _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)\n    if grid:\n        ax.grid(axis=\"y\", which=\"major\", color=\"#e6e5e3\", zorder=1)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"both\", labelsize=9)\n    for spine in [\"top\", \"right\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n    for spine in [\"bottom\", \"left\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_linewidth(1.1)\n    if title is not None:\n        ax.set_title(title, fontsize=12)\n    if xlabel is not None:\n        ax.set_xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=10)\n    if ylabel is not None:\n        ax.set_ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=10)\n    return ax"

    "section": "Why use GBDTs?",
    "text": "Why use GBDTs?\nWhat motivates the use of GBDTs for forecasting, particularly as an alternative to neural networks? Let’s have a cursory look at some relevant aspects (a more in-depth discussion of this topic can be found in this paper):\n\nModel implementation: Libraries like XGBoost and LightGBM are highly optimized and generally work right out of the box (i.e., it is not necessary to change their implementation). In the domain of deep learning, on the other hand, a standard architecture for forecasting has yet to emerge. While many types of models (and frameworks) have been proposed, they often require a non-trivial amount of customizations and/or experiments to work well for a given problem.\nHyperparameters: The default parameterization of standard GBDT libraries often provides a surprisingly competitive performance. Even if not, hyperparameter optimization is relatively straightforward with only a handful of (intuitively quite understandable) hyperparameters to tune. Tuning neural networks, meanwhile, is generally more complex, and is still often said to be more of an art than a science (i.e., it can require a lot of computation-intensive experimentation).\nFeature engineering: While neural networks typically require only gentle feature engineering (e.g., lag features), heavy feature engineering is considered the key to building highly competitive forecasting models with GBDTs. Fortunately, successful approaches to past problems can often be transferred to new ones (we’ll dive deeper into this soon), and fast training procedures allow to try out many features. What is very important in deep learning, however, is feature scaling. Unlike GBDTs (where feature scaling doesn’t matter), neural networks are typically very sensitive to the scaling of the features which can be particularly challenging when it comes to scaling lag features. A somewhat similar issue is posed by missing values which are handled natively by standard GBDT implementations but usually require imputation in deep learning.\nDiagnosability and interpretability: Arguably, diagnosing and interpreting tree-based models is relatively easy. Looking at solutions to similar problems as well as analyzing feature importances (e.g., using SHAP values) and prediction errors after running some experiments usually reveals directions for future improvements. Diagnosing and interpreting neural networks, on the other hand, is more challenging and time-consuming.\nPerformance: In principle, tree-based models don’t fall behind neural networks with regard to their forecasting performance. Actually, GBDTs combined with excellent feature engineering can consistently outperform neural networks. If the time series comes from a smooth process (e.g., measurements of a physical system), however, the known bias of neural networks towards smooth solutions will likely be very beneficial.\n\nWhat should we make of this? In short, tree-based models come with a higher ease of use. They can benefit from known best practices and can be improved quite intuitively with feature engineering. In a sense, using GBDTs for forecasting primarily requires an intimate understanding of the data while using deep learning primarily requires an intimate understanding of the model architecture and many experiments.\nBefore we dive deeper into how GBDTs can be used for forecasting, we’ll visit one topic that is absolutely crucial for tackling time series with any model: model validation."

    "section": "Time Series Cross-Validation",
    "text": "Time Series Cross-Validation\nIn time series, observations that are close to each other in time are typically highly correlated. This phenomenon is known as autocorrelation and makes intuitive sense: the sales of a given day generally provide some information about the sales of the next day, for example. It follows that we cannot use the standard cross-validation (CV) schemes (k-fold CV and its derivatives like stratified and group k-fold CV) for forecasting because they are based on the assumption that the samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and therefore ignore chronological order. Instead we have to replicate the actual forecasting process by only validating on future data using a procedure called time series cross-validation (tsCV, also known as rolling forward CV, walk forward CV, and temporal CV). tsCV can be conducted in two different ways: using expanding windows or using sliding windows.\n\n\nCode\n# adapted from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#time-series-split\nrng = np.random.RandomState(1)\ncmap_cv = plt.cm.gist_earth\nX = rng.randn(100, 10)\n\ndef plot_cv_indices(cv, X, ax, show_n_splits, lw=10):\n    # Generate the training/testing visualizations for each CV split\n    for ii, (tr, tt) in enumerate(cv.split(X)):\n        # Fill in indices with the training/test groups\n        indices = np.array([np.nan] * len(X))\n        indices[tt] = 1\n        indices[tr] = 0\n\n        # Visualize the results\n        ax.scatter(\n            range(len(indices)),\n            [ii + 0.5] * len(indices),\n            c=indices,\n            marker=\"_\",\n            lw=lw,\n            cmap=cmap_cv,\n            vmin=-0.2,\n            vmax=1.2,\n        )\n\n    # Formatting\n    yticklabels = list(range(show_n_splits))\n    ax.set(\n        yticks=np.arange(show_n_splits) + 0.5,\n        yticklabels=yticklabels,\n        xlabel=\"Sample index\",\n        ylabel=\"CV iteration\",\n        ylim=[show_n_splits + 0.2, -0.2],\n        xlim=[0, 100],\n    )\n    ax.legend(\n        [Patch(color=cmap_cv(0.02)), Patch(color=cmap_cv(0.8))],\n        [\"Training set\", \"Testing set\"],\n        loc=\"upper right\",\n        facecolor=\"white\", \n        edgecolor=\"white\"\n    )\n    return ax\n\n\n\nExpanding window setup\nIn the expanding window setup, the size of the training set increases in each successive CV iteration (i.e., the successive training sets are supersets of their predecessors) which is particularly useful when the dataset at hand is rather small. The visualization below is based on the ExpandingWindowSplitter provided in the sktime library.\n\n\nCode\nax = get_ax(figsize=(8, 3), title=\"tsCV with expanding windows\")\ntscv_ex = ExpandingWindowSplitter(fh=np.arange(20), initial_window=20, step_length=10)\nplot_cv_indices(tscv_ex, X, ax, show_n_splits=4);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSliding window setup\nIn the sliding window setup, the size of the training set is fixed so that the range of training rows moves forward in time with each CV iteration. Put another way, the oldest observations are dropped when new data is added to the training set, essentially keeping the model from attending to the distant past. Given enough data, this is usually the preferred setup in practice (keeping the size of the training set constant gives a more reliable estimate of a model’s performance). sktime’s SlidingWindowSplitter implements this functionality.\n\n\nCode\nax = get_ax(figsize=(8, 3), title=\"tsCV with sliding windows\")\ntscv_sl = SlidingWindowSplitter(fh=np.arange(20), window_length=20, step_length=10)\nplot_cv_indices(tscv_sl, X, ax, show_n_splits=4);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGap to production\nIn practice, there is often one further issue to keep in mind: the training data usually isn’t immediately available (the data has to be collected, validated, prepared, etc.) or other reasons cause a delay until the model can be put in production. If this is the case, the gap should be incorporated into the CV procedure.\n\n\nCode\nax = get_ax(figsize=(8, 3), title=\"tsCV with sliding windows and gaps\")\ntscv_slg = SlidingWindowSplitter(fh=np.arange(3, 20), window_length=20, step_length=10)\nplot_cv_indices(tscv_slg, X, ax, show_n_splits=4);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom setup\nThe generic approaches outlined above may serve as a basis for developing custom tsCV procedures that consider specific quirks of the dataset (e.g., groups) or better match the characteristics of the project. If the task is to predict daily values for the next four weeks, for example, it may make sense to use only the last four weeks of the training data for validation (or some four week windows near the end of the training data).\nNote that it is also possible to combine the expanding and sliding window approach (start with the expanding window setup and switch to the sliding window setup when the window has grown large enough) or compute a weighted average over all test windows to obtain the final CV score (e.g., giving more weight to a validation window that includes the last seasonal period or to the most recent window). Note that the faster training speed of GBDTs can be particularly advantageous in this context since it allows to validate against more validation windows in a timely manner."

    "text": "Evaluation Metric\nWith the validation scheme set up, choosing the right evaluation metric is the next important choice to make. A huge (and somewhat overwhelming) variety of metrics for evaluating forecasting models has been proposed, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. This 2022 paper provides a thorough review and a nice flowchart for picking the right one(s). In general (and unsurprisingly), the choice of evaluation metrics should be guided by the underlying business problem. In sales forecasting, for example, overestimation might be acceptable to some degree, while underestimation should be avoided (products that are not in stock cannot be sold and being out of stock comes with significant reputational risk); the metric should reflect this. In this context, it may be worthwhile to customize the loss function used by the model (XGBoost, for example, provides a tutorial on this) and/or transform the target to make the modeling easier."

    "section": "Modeling",
    "text": "Modeling\nIn order to apply GBDTs (or other ML methods) to time series, we have to transform the data into a supervised regression problem. This essentially means nothing more than that each row must contain all the features necessary for the model to make a prediction. There are some more aspects to consider, though.\n\nLocal vs. global models\nIf the dataset contains multiple time series (e.g., sales data for multiple stores), we have to decide whether to develop local models or a global model. While a local model is trained only on a single time series (e.g., on one store), a global model is trained across time series (e.g., on all stores; this is sometimes called cross-learning). If the underlying data generating process is not too dissimilar (or if we have good features that capture the differences), we will usually prefer global models since we can leverage the additional observations to build more complex and robust models. Recent research has even shown that global models can work well for heterogenous datasets.\n\n\nMulti-step forecasting\nGBDTs generally cannot predict sequences, but many forecasting tasks are sequence-to-sequence problems. That is, we often want to predict multiple time steps into the future. If features computed from recent target values are not crucial for the model, this is not an obstacle; in this case we can treat the problem as a regular regression problem (using one model to predict each row simultaneously). If not, there are essentially two ways to implement this: - Recursive forecasting: Recursively apply a one-step forecasting model, using the predictions of the last step for the computation of lag and window features for the current step. With this strategy the model has to be trained only once, but the accumulation of prediction errors can result in very bad model performance. - Direct forecasting: Directly predict the entire future sequence using multiple models (i.e., train one model for each forecasting step). Requires more computation, but avoids the accumulating bias of the recursive approach.\nThe ideal strategy depends on many factors like the forecast horizon, the size of the dataset, the complexity of the model and the problem, as well as time and resource constraints.\n\n\nNaive baseline\nWhen tackling forecasting problems, it is absolutely essential to compare models against naive baselines. The most common techniques: - For non-seasonal time series, predict the last observed value. This is the simplest possible benchmark and sometimes called the persistence model or no-change model. In general, the more a time series resembles a random walk, the competitive the naive benchmark will be. - For seasonal time series, predict the last observed seasonal value (e.g., predict the value exactly one week ago in a series with weekly periodicity). This is known as the seasonal naive method.\nOf course, there may be other naive approaches that are appropriate for a particular dataset or problem (e.g., predict the median of last week), and it is generally worthwhile to check the performance of traditional (statistical) forecasting methods like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing. Surprisingly often one finds that these baselines are quite hard to beat. Even if not, more complex models sometimes provide only a relatively small percentage improvement. (These little improvements, however, might very well have huge consequences in practice.)\n\n\nTrend adjustment\nGBDTs cannot extrapolate trends. To deal with this, we can modify the target by detrending the time series. There are multiple options to do this: - create a new target (e.g., subtract the mean target value of the last month or the last seasonal value) - predict the residuals of a baseline model (e.g., a ridge regression model or even a more complex sequence-to-sequence neural network) - use the predictions of a baseline model as a feature (e.g., a linear model with time steps as features or a more complex model)\n\n\nPost processing\nSometimes a simple post-processing measure (e.g., multiplying predictions by a constant just above or below \\(1\\)) can be used to correct systematic biases of a forecasting model. Of course, it is generally a bad sign when a simple technique like that leads to significant improvements; there should be a principled way to correct a systematic error by improving the model itself. In practice though, this may be easier said than done."

    "section": "Feature Engineering",
    "text": "Feature Engineering\nFinally, let’s turn our attention to feature engineering. As with tabular data, feature engineering is crucial when tackling time series problems with tree-based methods. But due to the time dimension of the data, there are some kinds of features that are not seen in tabular problems.\n\nTemporal features\nMany useful features can be derived from the date or time stamp associated with each observation. Some examples:\n\ntime steps\nhour of day\nday of week\nweek of year\nmonth\nquarter\nseason\nis weekend\nis public holiday (is christmas, is easter, etc.)\nis school holiday\nis payday week\nis daylight saving time\nis event (e.g., is promotion, is world cup game, is first Saturday of the month, etc.)\nevent counters (e.g., the number of days until, into, and after an event)\nnumber of trading days in month\nweights (e.g., put a higher weight on more recent observations or the last seasonal period)\nFourier features\n\n\n\nLag features\nLag features represent values at prior timesteps (e.g., the number of restaurant reservations on the same day last week, number of radio ads run yesterday). They can be computed for both the target and features and usually turn out to be important predictors in practice (in sales forecasting, for example, the last available value will hold a lot of information).\n\n\nWindow features\nWindow (or rolling) features compute a summary statistic over a window of past data. This too can be done for both the target (e.g., the mean, median, standard deviation etc. of last week) and features (e.g., the minimum weekly ad spend last month). In general, one can try computing statistics for different periods (e.g., last day, the same period last season), different groups (e.g., days of the week, events), and different levels of the hierarchy (e.g., department level, state level, country level).\nThe optimal window sizes generally depend on the patterns in the data, but because using window features renders the data at the beginning of the time series unusable (the window features would be NaNs) it is usually better to avoid large window sizes.\n\n\nDifference features\nComputing differences between different points in time (or aggregations) is another strategy that is often very useful. Intuitively, difference features help the model understand changes over time or fluctuations (e.g., subtract the weekly mean from daily observations to see how each day differs from the mean).\n\n\nFinding good features\nHow can we find good features? There are some strategies that can help:\n\nAnalyze the seasonalities\nPlot the prediction errors of the model (over the entire series, by seasonality, by length of the forecast horizon, by groups in the data, etc.)\nAnalyze feature importances over different periods\nAnalyze solutions to similar problems\n\n\n\nAvoid temporal leaks\nA final word of caution: when creating time-related features it is imperative to make sure that all values will be available at inference time. A rather obvious example is weather data: knowing the amount of rain or the average windspeed on a given day will most likely be of value when predicting drug store sales, but these data won’t be readily available in advance. Whether or not it is possible to use predictions for these kinds of features depends on the problem (e.g., it will probably work to use weather forecasts when we only want to predict the next three days, but get prohibitively hard when we want to predict the sales of a whole month). A trickier example is target encoding (or any computation over the entire series): using the entire training data (i.e. before creating the CV split) for target encoding will create a temporal leak, causing us to overestimate the performance of the model. At inference time data leaks will end up being (highly) detrimental and might even cause the model to fail entirely."

    "text": "A proper validation strategy is key for building a good model. Without a good validation scheme, we won’t be able to correctly evaluate a model’s prediction errors; hence, we won’t know which changes really lead to a performance improvement. Thus, investing time in designing a reliable validation scheme is crucial for the success of a project.\nIn essence, the question of model evaluation boils down to deciding how the dataset is partitioned in samples for training and samples for validation and testing. The most basic strategy is a simple train-test split that splits the dataset into a training set (e.g., 80% of the data) and a test set. But since this strategy involves regularly checking the model’s performance on the test set, it will quickly lead to overfitting. Thus, we can improve this strategy by splitting the data into three parts (i.e., separate sets for training, validation, and testing) and use the test set only for estimating the final performance of the model on unseen data. The best practice, however, is to first put aside the test set and then use a flavor of k-fold cross-validation (CV) to evaluate the training procedure on the remaining data. This way, we further reduce the risk of overfitting and can get a more reliable estimate of the model’s performance. For a more thorough discussion of this topic, see this popular paper.\n\n\nLet’s dive deeper into the different variations of k-fold CV.\nNote: We borrow some code from the scikit-learn user guide to visualize the different strategies.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.patches import Patch\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold, StratifiedKFold, GroupKFold, StratifiedGroupKFold\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef get_ax(figsize=(11, 4), grid=False, title=None, xlabel=None, ylabel=None):\n    _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)\n    for spine in [\"top\", \"right\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n    for spine in [\"bottom\", \"left\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_linewidth(1.1)\n    if title is not None:\n        ax.set_title(title, fontsize=12)\n    if xlabel is not None:\n        ax.set_xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=10)\n    if ylabel is not None:\n        ax.set_ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=10)\n\n    return ax\n\n# From https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html\nrng = np.random.RandomState(1)\ncmap_data = plt.cm.jet\ncmap_cv = plt.cm.gist_earth\n\n# Generate the class/group data\nn_points = 100\nX = rng.randn(100, 10)\n\npercentiles_classes = [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]\ny = np.hstack([[ii] * int(100 * perc) for ii, perc in enumerate(percentiles_classes)])\n\n# Generate uneven groups\ngroup_prior = rng.dirichlet([2] * 10)\ngroups = np.repeat(np.arange(10), rng.multinomial(100, group_prior))\n\ndef plot_cv(cv, X, y, group, ax, n_splits, lw=10):\n    \"\"\"Create a sample plot for indices of a cross-validation object.\"\"\"\n\n    # Generate the training/testing visualizations for each CV split\n    for ii, (tr, tt) in enumerate(cv.split(X=X, y=y, groups=group)):\n        # Fill in indices with the training/test groups\n        indices = np.array([np.nan] * len(X))\n        indices[tt] = 1\n        indices[tr] = 0\n\n        # Visualize the results\n        ax.scatter(\n            range(len(indices)),\n            [ii + 0.5] * len(indices),\n            c=indices,\n            marker=\"_\",\n            lw=lw,\n            cmap=cmap_cv,\n            vmin=-0.2,\n            vmax=1.2,\n        )\n\n    # Plot the data classes and groups at the end\n    ax.scatter(range(len(X)), [ii + 1.5] * len(X), c=y, marker=\"_\", lw=lw, cmap=cmap_data)\n    ax.scatter(range(len(X)), [ii + 2.5] * len(X), c=group, marker=\"_\", lw=lw, cmap=cmap_data)\n\n    # Formatting\n    yticklabels = list(range(n_splits)) + [\"class\", \"group\"]\n    ax.set(\n        yticks=np.arange(n_splits + 2) + 0.5,\n        yticklabels=yticklabels,\n        xlabel=\"Sample index\",\n        ylabel=\"CV iteration\",\n        ylim=[n_splits + 2.2, -0.2],\n        xlim=[0, 100],\n    )\n    ax.set_title(str(type(cv).__name__), fontsize=12)\n    return ax\n\n\n\n\nThe most used version of \\(k\\)-fold CV is implemented in scikit-learn’s KFold cross-validator.KFold simply splits the dataset into \\(k\\) partitions (where \\(k\\) is typically between \\(3\\) and \\(10\\)). Then, in \\(k\\) iterations, one of the \\(k\\) partitions (or “folds”) is used as a validation set while the others are used as a training set for the model (i.e., the model is trained on \\(k-1\\) folds in every iteration). Eventually, we’ll end up with predictions for every observation in the dataset (the so-called out-of-fold predictions, or oof in short, because in each iteration the model only predicts samples it has not seen during training). To obtain the overall CV score, we simply average the \\(k\\) validation scores.\nThe plot below shows the basic k-fold CV scheme with \\(4\\) folds. Note that the class and group structure of the data is ignored.\n\n\nCode\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = KFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it is often the case that there are some classes in the data (in the target and/or in features) that appear (much) less frequently than others. A typical example for an imbalanced target is transaction data where we have to predict the very rare event of a fraudulent transaction. In situations like this we’ll want to preserve the class distribution in our validation scheme using stratified k-fold CV.\nThe plot below shows this strategy using scikit-learn’s StratifiedKFold (stratified on the imbalanced target y which has three classes).\nNote that the same approach can be used in regression problems with skewed variables or variables that have long tails. To preserve the variable’s distribution across folds we can simply stratify on a discretized version of that variable. If we need to preserve the distribution of multiple variables, we can use iterative stratification (an implementation can be found here).\n\n\nCode\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother common issue concerns non-i.i.d. data. As an example, consider a dataset with data about many different users and multiple observations per user. If there are observations of a user in both the training and the validation data, we’ll overestimate the model’s performance on unseen users. Thus, we’ll want to make sure that groups in the data appear either in the training or in the validation samples, but not in both. This functionality is implemented in scikit-learn’s GroupKFold. Note that such groups in the data may only be revealed by thorough analysis (e.g., using cluster analysis) and leveraging domain knowledge.\n\n\nCode\n\n#| code-fold: true\n\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = GroupKFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, we may face a problem where want to preserve the distribution of a variable and split on groups. This can be done using scikit-learn’s StratifiedGroupKFold. Note: If the distribution of classes in each group is relatively close it is better to use GroupKFold.\n\n\nCode\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the examples above, the data wasn’t shuffled before the partitioning of the data. But if the ordering of the data is not arbitrary (e.g., if the observations are ordered by class), shuffling is usually necessary (just set shuffle=True when instantiating the cross-validator). However, care must be taken if there is a time dimension in the data (e.g., multiple observations of a physical process that are close in time). In this case, shuffling the data may put samples in the validation set that are very similar to the ones in the training set.\n\n\n\nWe generally shouldn’t use the same data for optimizing the hyperparameters of a model and evaluating its performance. This is where nested CV comes in. The idea is simple: We’ll still use an outer loop that splits the dataset into \\(k\\) folds at each iteration. But we’ll also use an inner loop that splits the data again to get a new set of samples for training and validation in each (inner) iteration. Since the hyperparameter tuning only happens with respect to the data exposed by the outer loop, the risk of overfitting is reduced. However, this comes at the price of much higher computational effort and a reduced amount of available training data. Thus, we’ll often resort to using the same CV scheme for both model/parameter search and model evaluation even though this poses a higher risk of overfitting.\n\n\n\n\nWhile adverserial validation is not a classic validation strategy, it can be really helpful to determine the reliability of an existing validation scheme. For example, we may be unsure whether we really picked a representative sample of our dataset for testing our model. To answer this question, we can follow a simple procedure: Concatenate the training and the test data, delete the target column, add a binary column indicating whether a row comes from the training or the test set, and train a classifier (e.g., a Random Forest) to predict this new target. Ideally, the resulting classifier will have a ROC-AUC around \\(0.5\\) meaning that it cannot tell both datasets apart. A ROC-AUC closer to \\(1.0\\) would instead indicate that the training and the test data come from different distributions and that our validation method isn’t robust. Note that we can use the same approach to detect concept drift (i.e., changing patterns and relations over time) in our data.\n\n\n\nNo matter which specific validation strategy is chosen, it is imperative to avoid information leaks from the training data to the validation/test data. There are multiple potential sources for these leaks, common ones are:\n\nPreprocessing: Preprocessing methods (e.g., normalization, target encoding, dimensionality reduction) have to be fitted exclusively on the training set. If a preprocessing method modifies the entire data (i.e., before it is partitioned into training, validation, and test data), information inevitably leaks from the training data.\nAvailability of features: The dataset may contain features that are not available at inference time. This probably sounds obvious but can be complicated in practice (e.g., sensor data may be collected before a prediction has to be made but won’t become available in time), and has to be fixed (either by dropping the feature or making sure that it is available).\nGroups: This was already discussed, but finding these groups can be very hard. Imagine a dataset containing some kind of rating created by human evaluators. If the rows are sorted by evaluator (and the ratings aren’t perfectly objective), there is a leak in the ordering of the observations."

    "text": "A proper validation strategy is key for building a good model. Without a good validation scheme, we won’t be able to correctly evaluate a model’s prediction errors; hence, we won’t know which changes really lead to a performance improvement. Thus, investing time in designing a reliable validation scheme is crucial for the success of a project.\nIn essence, the question of model evaluation boils down to deciding how the dataset is partitioned in samples for training and samples for validation and testing. The most basic strategy is a simple train-test split that splits the dataset into a training set (e.g., 80% of the data) and a test set. But since this strategy involves regularly checking the model’s performance on the test set, it will quickly lead to overfitting. Thus, we can improve this strategy by splitting the data into three parts (i.e., separate sets for training, validation, and testing) and use the test set only for estimating the final performance of the model on unseen data. The best practice, however, is to first put aside the test set and then use a flavor of k-fold cross-validation (CV) to evaluate the training procedure on the remaining data. This way, we further reduce the risk of overfitting and can get a more reliable estimate of the model’s performance. For a more thorough discussion of this topic, see this popular paper.\n\n\nLet’s dive deeper into the different variations of k-fold CV.\nNote: We borrow some code from the scikit-learn user guide to visualize the different strategies.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.patches import Patch\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold, StratifiedKFold, GroupKFold, StratifiedGroupKFold\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef get_ax(figsize=(11, 4), grid=False, title=None, xlabel=None, ylabel=None):\n    _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize)\n    for spine in [\"top\", \"right\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n    for spine in [\"bottom\", \"left\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_linewidth(1.1)\n    if title is not None:\n        ax.set_title(title, fontsize=12)\n    if xlabel is not None:\n        ax.set_xlabel(xlabel, fontsize=10)\n    if ylabel is not None:\n        ax.set_ylabel(ylabel, fontsize=10)\n\n    return ax\n\n# From https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_cv_indices.html\nrng = np.random.RandomState(1)\ncmap_data = plt.cm.jet\ncmap_cv = plt.cm.gist_earth\n\n# Generate the class/group data\nn_points = 100\nX = rng.randn(100, 10)\n\npercentiles_classes = [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]\ny = np.hstack([[ii] * int(100 * perc) for ii, perc in enumerate(percentiles_classes)])\n\n# Generate uneven groups\ngroup_prior = rng.dirichlet([2] * 10)\ngroups = np.repeat(np.arange(10), rng.multinomial(100, group_prior))\n\ndef plot_cv(cv, X, y, group, ax, n_splits, lw=10):\n    \"\"\"Create a sample plot for indices of a cross-validation object.\"\"\"\n\n    # Generate the training/testing visualizations for each CV split\n    for ii, (tr, tt) in enumerate(cv.split(X=X, y=y, groups=group)):\n        # Fill in indices with the training/test groups\n        indices = np.array([np.nan] * len(X))\n        indices[tt] = 1\n        indices[tr] = 0\n\n        # Visualize the results\n        ax.scatter(\n            range(len(indices)),\n            [ii + 0.5] * len(indices),\n            c=indices,\n            marker=\"_\",\n            lw=lw,\n            cmap=cmap_cv,\n            vmin=-0.2,\n            vmax=1.2,\n        )\n\n    # Plot the data classes and groups at the end\n    ax.scatter(range(len(X)), [ii + 1.5] * len(X), c=y, marker=\"_\", lw=lw, cmap=cmap_data)\n    ax.scatter(range(len(X)), [ii + 2.5] * len(X), c=group, marker=\"_\", lw=lw, cmap=cmap_data)\n\n    # Formatting\n    yticklabels = list(range(n_splits)) + [\"class\", \"group\"]\n    ax.set(\n        yticks=np.arange(n_splits + 2) + 0.5,\n        yticklabels=yticklabels,\n        xlabel=\"Sample index\",\n        ylabel=\"CV iteration\",\n        ylim=[n_splits + 2.2, -0.2],\n        xlim=[0, 100],\n    )\n    ax.set_title(str(type(cv).__name__), fontsize=12)\n    return ax\n\n\n\n\nThe most used version of \\(k\\)-fold CV is implemented in scikit-learn’s KFold cross-validator.KFold simply splits the dataset into \\(k\\) partitions (where \\(k\\) is typically between \\(3\\) and \\(10\\)). Then, in \\(k\\) iterations, one of the \\(k\\) partitions (or “folds”) is used as a validation set while the others are used as a training set for the model (i.e., the model is trained on \\(k-1\\) folds in every iteration). Eventually, we’ll end up with predictions for every observation in the dataset (the so-called out-of-fold predictions, or oof in short, because in each iteration the model only predicts samples it has not seen during training). To obtain the overall CV score, we simply average the \\(k\\) validation scores.\nThe plot below shows the basic k-fold CV scheme with \\(4\\) folds. Note that the class and group structure of the data is ignored.\n\n\nCode\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = KFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, it is often the case that there are some classes in the data (in the target and/or in features) that appear (much) less frequently than others. A typical example for an imbalanced target is transaction data where we have to predict the very rare event of a fraudulent transaction. In situations like this we’ll want to preserve the class distribution in our validation scheme using stratified k-fold CV.\nThe plot below shows this strategy using scikit-learn’s StratifiedKFold (stratified on the imbalanced target y which has three classes).\nNote that the same approach can be used in regression problems with skewed variables or variables that have long tails. To preserve the variable’s distribution across folds we can simply stratify on a discretized version of that variable. If we need to preserve the distribution of multiple variables, we can use iterative stratification (an implementation can be found here).\n\n\nCode\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = StratifiedKFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother common issue concerns non-i.i.d. data. As an example, consider a dataset with data about many different users and multiple observations per user. If there are observations of a user in both the training and the validation data, we’ll overestimate the model’s performance on unseen users. Thus, we’ll want to make sure that groups in the data appear either in the training or in the validation samples, but not in both. This functionality is implemented in scikit-learn’s GroupKFold. Note that such groups in the data may only be revealed by thorough analysis (e.g., using cluster analysis) and leveraging domain knowledge.\n\n\nCode\n\n#| code-fold: true\n\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = GroupKFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaturally, we may face a problem where want to preserve the distribution of a variable and split on groups. This can be done using scikit-learn’s StratifiedGroupKFold. Note: If the distribution of classes in each group is relatively close it is better to use GroupKFold.\n\n\nCode\n_, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3))\nn_splits = 4\ncv = StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits)\nplot_cv(cv, X, y, groups, ax, n_splits);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the examples above, the data wasn’t shuffled before the partitioning of the data.

    "text": "Metrics\nChoosing the right metric(s) is important in any ML task. While we may first think of the typical (mathematical) metrics for evaluating the predictive performance of a model (i.e., metrics that compare the predictions and the ground truth to compute a score), there are usually a lot of other relevant metrics in a project. Some examples are:\n\ninterpretability of the model\nmaintainability of the model\nmemory and compute requirements\ntraining and inference costs\nlatency of the inference process\ntime for development\n\nWhich criteria matter the most heavily depends on the project.\nHere, we’ll take a brief look at the most common (mathematical) evaluation metrics for regression and classification. But first, some general remarks about evaluation metrics:\n\nThe metric should be chosen according to the requirements of the project. For instance, if it is more important to avoid underestimation than overestimation, the metric should reflect this. Also, it is always possible to check multiple metrics.\nIn an ideal setting, the evaluation metric matches the objective function used by the model. Note that GBDTs and deep learning models generally allow custom objective functions.\nIf the evaluation metric doesn’t match the objective function, it is essential to at least tune the hyperparameters of the model based on the metric we really care about.\n\n\nMetrics for regression\n\nMean squared error (MSE)\nThe MSE is the mean of the sum of squared errors (SSE). To compute the SSE we simply sum the squared differences between the predictions and the ground truth. Since regression models typically minimize the SSE, it is usually straightforward to minimize the MSE. Expressed mathematically:\n\\[\\text{MSE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\text{SSE},\\]\nwhere \\(y_i\\) represents the ground truth, and \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) the prediction.\n\n\nRoot mean squared error (RMSE)\nRMSE is the square root of the MSE, and often used in regression problems. It is generally preferred for two reasons: - its value is on the original scale of the target (since we take the root of squared errors), allowing a more intuitive understanding - it penalizes large prediction errors to a lesser extent than MSE (again, due to taking the square root)\nExpressed mathematically:\n\\[\\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\text{MSE}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}.\\]\nIn practice, it may work better to take the square root of the target and use MSE as objective function (squaring the results afterwards).\n\n\nR squared (\\(R^2\\))\nThe \\(R^2\\) metric compares the squared errors of the model against the squared errors when predicting the mean of the target (which is also known as the sum of squares total, SST). Expressed mathematically:\n\\[R^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{(y_i - \\bar{y})^2} = \\frac{\\text{SSE}}{\\text{SST}},\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{y}\\) represents the mean of the target.\n\n\nRoot mean squared log error (RMSLE)\nRMSLE is another extension of the MSE and a good choice when we care about the scale of our predictions with respect to the scale of the ground truth (due to taking the logarithm, we focus on the relative error between the predicted and the actual values). Note that RMSLE penalizes underestimation more than overestimation. Expressed mathematically:\n\\[\\text{RMSLE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\log(\\hat{y}_i + 1) - \\log(y_i + 1) \\right)^2},\\]\nwhere \\(\\log(x)\\) means the natural logarithm of \\(x\\).\nIn practice, it may work better to take the logarithm of the target before fitting the model (putting the results back on the original scale using the exponential function afterwards).\n\n\nMean absolute error (MAE)\nThe MAE represents the mean of the absolute differences between the predictions and the ground truth. It is on the original scale of the target and less sensitive to outliers (given that there is no squaring operation). Expressed mathematically:\n\\[\\text{MAE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lvert y_i - \\hat{y}_i \\rvert\\]\n\n\n\nMetrics for binary classification\n\nAccuracy\nAccuracy, the number of correct predictions as a ratio of all predictions, is the simplest metric for binary classification problems. However, it is only easily interpretable when there is no class imbalance. For instance, if the minority class makes up only 5% of the data, a model that only predicts the majority class will have an accuracy of 95%. Expressed mathematically:\n\\[\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{correct predictions}}{\\text{total predictions}}\\]\n\n\nPrecision and recall\nThe metrics of precision and recall usually provide a better picture than accuracy. To understand them, consider the following four quantities:\n\nTrue positives (TP): True positives are examples that have been correctly predicted as positive ones (i.e., as belonging to some class).\nFalse positives (FP): False positives are examples that have been incorrectly predicted as positives.\nTrue negatives (TN): True negatives are examples that have been correctly predicted as negative ones (i.e., as not belonging to some class).\nFalse negatives (FN): False negatives are examples that have been incorrectly predicted as negatives.\n\nExample: Consider a classifier that should recognize dogs in pictures of dogs and cats. In a picture with five dogs and three cats, a program correctly detects four dogs (true positives), misses one (false negative), incorrectly detects a dog that is actually a cat (false positive), and correctly excludes two cats (true negatives).\nWe can use these quantities to compute the accuracy:\n\\[\\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{TN} + \\text{FP} + \\text{FN}}.\\]\nHowever, we can also compute other metrics that can give us a better understanding of the performance of a classifier.\nPrecision (also called specificity) is the accuracy of the positive cases, telling us how often the classifier is correct when predicting a positive. Optimizing for precision means that the model should only predict the positive class if it is very confident.\n\\[\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FP}}\\]\nRecall (also called sensitivity, true positive rate, or coverage), on the other hand, measures the fraction of positive cases that have been correctly predicted:\n\\[\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}}\\]\n\n\nF1 score\nIn general, there is a trade-off between precision and recall. By altering the threshold for predicting the positive or the negative class (usually set at a probability of \\(0.5\\)) we can improve one of the metrics at the expense of the other. Thus, both metrics always have to be considered together.\nTo make things easier, the commonly used F1 score provides the harmonic mean of precision and recall:\n\\[\\text{F1} = 2 \\cdot\\ \\frac{\\text{precision} \\cdot \\text{recall}}{\\text{precision} + \\text{recall}}.\\]\nAn alternative is the F-beta score where beta influences the weight of recall in the score:\n\\[F_{\\beta} = \\frac{(1 + \\beta^2)\\cdot(\\text{precision} \\cdot \\text{recall})}{(\\beta^2 \\cdot \\text{precision} + \\text{recall})}\\]\n\n\nLog loss\nLog loss, also known as cross-entropy and a commonly used metric, measures the difference between the predicted probability and the ground truth probability. Thus, log loss considers the confidence of the classifier. Expressed mathematically:\n\\[\\text{Log loss} = -\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i) + (1- y_{i})\\log (1 - \\hat{y}_t) \\right]\\]\n\n\nROC-AUC\nPlotting the true positive rate (i.e., recall) against the false positive rate (i.e., the ratio of negative examples that are incorrectly classified as positive ones) gives the so-called receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve). While the ROC curve of a bad classifier will be near the diagonal of the chart (the diagonal represents a classifier with random predictions), the area under the curve (AUC) of a good classifier will be significantly higher (ideally 1.0). ROC-AUC, as the corresponding metric is called, is very common in practice.\n\n\n\nMetrics for multi-class classification\nFor multi-class classification we can simply apply a metric for binary classification to each class and compute an average. Three common averaging strategies are:\n\nMacro averaging: Compute the metric for each class and then average the results. This approach treats all classes equally.\nMicro averaging: Sum the metrics for each class. This approach is preferable if there is class imbalance.\nWeighting: Compute the metric for each class and then a weighted average of the results. Allows to put more emphasis on more relevant classes or to adjust for class imbalance.\n\nCorrespondingly, common metrics for multi-class classification are:\n\nMacro-F1 and Micro-F1\nMulticlass log loss\nMulticlass accuracy"

    "text": "In tabular problems, feature engineering can have a huge impact, potentially separating mediocre models from fantastic models. In essence, engineering features can serve three purposes:\n\nIncrease the predictive performance and generalization of a model\nIncrease the interpretability of a model\nReduce the complexity of a model (memory footprint, computational requirements)\n\nHow can we come up with a great set of features? Successful feature engineering begins with a thorough understanding of the business problem that we want to solve (e.g., if the data concerns human decisions, imagine the decision process and think about each step and how they interact; what would have influenced you in your decision?) and the data we have (we already covered this in the section about EDA; what can the features tell us about the target?). Then we should ask how we can transform our data in representations that can be better exploited by our model. This is a highly creative endeavor and should be treated as such. Which features would help you if you had to make a prediction? Which features could help the model detect patterns in the data? Hold brainstorming sessions and try to get inspirations from solutions that worked well in similar problems. Also, error analysis really is very important. Sorting the observations by error and plotting the residuals for different groups in the data are common strategies for revealing relevant patterns that can lead to new ideas and directions for feature engineering.\nIn general, the best features will be problem-specific and therefore hard to systematize. Nonetheless, we can look at some general feature engineering techniques that can help in many problems. Depending on the problem domain (e.g., biology, finance) there may be many other common techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreating missing values:\n\nFill in the correct value: In some cases, we may know the correct value. For instance, if NaN sales simply means an absence of any transactions, we can replace missing values with 0s. Note that there are cases where NaN actually is the correct value (e.g., the age of the spouse for singles).\nKeep the missing values: Assuming that we use a model that can handle NaNs natively (like XGBoost and its relatives), this is generally the best approach. Keeping missing values allows the model to capture information that is contained in the missingness (e.g., in a dataset for tax fraud detection, missingness may not occur at random but rather tell us a lot about the target). Alternatively, try replacing NaNs with a value that is far from the other values (e.g., -999; depending on the implementation, this can result in slightly different splits).\nAdd a binary column: It can help to add a binary column that indicates whether a value is/was missing.\nImputation: Since we want to preserve the data properties and don’t want to break our model (linear models can be quite sensitive in this regard), good imputation is very challenging. While there are many possible techniques (just see the scikit-learn user guide), it is quite common to fill in the mean or median. (Needless to say, the imputation value should only be derived from the training data.) However, filling in a constant value can often cause problems (e.g., when there are groups in the data). If domain knowledge doesn’t come to the rescue, it is best to just use a model that handles missingness natively.\n\nTreating outliers: Outliers are usually detrimental to the performance of a model. Thus, it is important to identify and treat them if necessary.\n\nIdentify outliers: There is no general method to identify outliers. If domain knowledge doesn’t help, common techniques are based on the standard deviation (e.g., values that fall outside of 3 standard deviations from the mean) or interquartile range (e.g., values that fall outside of 1.5 * IQR). For more sophisticated approaches see the scikit-learn guide.\nTreat outliers: The best treatment of outliers ultimately depends on the problem. While we may want to keep outliers in some settings (e.g., in anomaly detection), we’ll want to cap, modify or remove them in others. It can also be useful to add a binary column indicating known outliers.\n\nBinning: There are three typical motives for binning: reducing the memory footprint of a feature, removing noise and errors, and making it easier to model non-linear relationships between a feature and the target. Common methods for binning are pandas’ cut and scikit-learn’s KBinsDiscretizer. Binning can be combined with/used for frequency encoding.\nRounding: This is another form of lossy compression. Can be useful when high degrees of precision translate to noise.\nSplitting: Split a value into its integer and decimal part. Can be useful in certain use cases (e.g., prices).\nRanking: Rank the observations by a feature column (e.g., using the rank() method in pandas) and use the ranks as a feature.\nTransforming: Transforming numerical variables can be useful to increase the performance and/or the interpretability of a model. (Note: Tree-based models generally don’t benefit from feature scaling. However, it can sometimes help to transform the target in order to better optimize for some objective function.)\n\nLogarithmic transformation: Taking the (natural) logarithm is often seen in practice and can have multiple benefits.\n\nThe log transformation can reduce skewness and improve the fit of the model. In practice, the log transform is often used as a default preprocessing technique when a variable is heavy-tailed.\nThe log transformation can increase the interpretability of a coefficient.\nA linear model on the logarithmic scale corresponds to a multiplicative model on the original scale.\nLog transforming outcomes that are all positive forces the predictions to be positive.\n\nSquare root transformation: Taking the square root of a variable is an alternative to the logarithmic transformation that compresses high values more mildly. It doesn’t come with the interpretability benefits of the log transform, however.\nStandardization:\n\nusing \\(z\\)-scores: Subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. This is the default preprocessing approach for neural networks (which generally require and are quite sensitive to feature scaling). Implemented in scikit-learn’s StandardScaler.\nusing a reasonable scale: To increase interpretability, it can sometimes help to rescale variables (e.g., divide income by 10,000).\n\nNormalization: Subtract the minimum value and divide by the range. Implemented in scikit-learn’s MinMaxScaler; an alternative to standardization for neural networks.\nCentering: Centering a variable (by subtracting the mean or another reference value) can improve interpretability.\nOther: Other common scalers are scikit-learn’s RobustScaler which is less sensitive to outliers, as well as PowerTransformer and QuantileTransformer (which is probably a good choice when preprocessing tabular data for neural networks) which can be used to make data more Gaussian-like. See here for a comparison of different scaling methods.\nIdiosyncratic transformations: Depending on the problem, there may be custom transformations that are useful.\n\nDimensionality reduction: Run PCA/t-SNE/UMAP on the data and use the outputs as features.\nPolynomial features: Raise features to an exponent.\nAggregations/Group statistics: If there are groups in the data (e.g., age groups, areas, dates, departments, clusters derived by cluster analysis), compute features for each group (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, sum, skewness, kurtosis, etc.). This can help the model pick up differences between groups. Try combining multiple groups before computing group statistics.\nInteractions: Add, subtract, multiply or divide two features. These features are often very important (while two features may not correlate with the target on their own, their interaction may very well provide signal).\n\n\n\n\n\nTreating missing values:\n\nFill in the correct value: Determine the correct value using domain knowledge.\nKeep the missing values: Use a model that can handle missing values natively. Again, this is probably the best approach.\nCreate a new category: Create a new category that represents missing values. Instead of NaN we can use a value that is markedly different from the other values (e.g., a large negative value like -999).\nFill in the mode (or another category): Like with numerical variables, this is usually not the best idea. Use a model that can handle missing values instead.\n\nSplitting into multiple categories: Depending on the dataset, there may be features that can be derived from splitting a categorical variable. Below are some common ones.\n\nDates/Timestamps: Many features can be derived directly from dates and timestamps (e.g., year, month, day, week of year, quarter, etc.).\nAddresses: Addresses can be split into state, city, district, etc.\nUser agent: Many features can be derived from user agent strings (used in HTTP): is_mobile, is_latest_version, operating_system, etc.\n\nCombining multiple categories in one: Sometimes merging two categorical features into one can help the model (e.g., slightly different job descriptions, very rare categories).\nEncoding:\n\nLabel encoding: Convert each category to a unique integer label (e.g., using scikit-learn’s OrdinalEncoder or pandas’ factorize() method). This is the default approach for tree-based models and usually works surprisingly well. An option for neural networks.\nOne-hot encoding: Create a binary column for each category (e.g., using scikit-learn’s OneHotEncoder. This is the default approach for linear models (where one category is usually used as a baseline). An option for neural networks.\nFrequency encoding: Replace each category with its frequency in the training data (e.g., by using pandas’ value_counts() as a dictionary). Alternatively, try converting to ranks.\nTarget encoding: Replace each category with the corresponding target probability (in classification) or average (in regression). Can be the best encoding technique, but comes with a higher risk of overfitting (it can help to add some noise to combat this). See here for an implementation.\nEmbeddings: Create vector embeddings that represent categorical data. Primarily useful for neural networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuite often we find that there is a feature that would provide a lot of signal to the model but isn’t available in the dataset. In situations like this, it may be possible to create a model that leverages the existing data and can predict the feature in question accurately enough. An example: Imagine that we want to create a model that predicts the number of clicks generated by ads for used cars. Common sense tells us that the number of clicks will depend on how the price offered in the ad compares to the typical market price of the product. Maybe we can create a model that predicts the price of the car and use the price difference as a feature?\n\n\n\n\nWhile column-based features are probably more intuitive, it can also be beneficial to compute row-wise features to help the model find patterns in the data. Some examples are:\n\nCompute the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, sum, etc. of the numeric values (or a reasonable subset).\nCompute an average score of how much the column values deviate from their mean or median.\nCount missing values, 0s, positive/negative values, etc.\nClustering: Cluster the data (e.g., using an unsupervised algorithm) and add the cluster labels as a feature."

    "text": "In tabular problems, feature engineering can have a huge impact, potentially separating mediocre models from fantastic models. In essence, engineering features can serve three purposes:\n\nIncrease the predictive performance and generalization of a model\nIncrease the interpretability of a model\nReduce the complexity of a model (memory footprint, computational requirements)\n\nHow can we come up with a great set of features? Successful feature engineering begins with a thorough understanding of the business problem that we want to solve (e.g., if the data concerns human decisions, imagine the decision process and think about each step and how they interact; what would have influenced you in your decision?) and the data we have (we already covered this in the section about EDA; what can the features tell us about the target?). Then we should ask how we can transform our data in representations that can be better exploited by our model. This is a highly creative endeavor and should be treated as such. Which features would help you if you had to make a prediction? Which features could help the model detect patterns in the data? Hold brainstorming sessions and try to get inspirations from solutions that worked well in similar problems. Also, error analysis really is very important. Sorting the observations by error and plotting the residuals for different groups in the data are common strategies for revealing relevant patterns that can lead to new ideas and directions for feature engineering.\nIn general, the best features will be problem-specific and therefore hard to systematize. Nonetheless, we can look at some general feature engineering techniques that can help in many problems. Depending on the problem domain (e.g., biology, finance) there may be many other common techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreating missing values:\n\nFill in the correct value: In some cases, we may know the correct value. For instance, if NaN sales simply means an absence of any transactions, we can replace missing values with 0s. Note that there are cases where NaN actually is the correct value (e.g., the age of the spouse for singles).\nKeep the missing values: Assuming that we use a model that can handle NaNs natively (like XGBoost and its relatives), this is generally the best approach.

    "title": "Tackling Tabular Problems III: Feature Engineering & Selection",
    "section": "Feature selection",
    "text": "Feature selection\nEven though we hope that every newly created feature provides important information to the model, this is usually not the case. Instead we’ll often end up with many features that are not really relevant for the problem or even just introduce noise. Thus, feature selection (i.e., reducing the size of the feature set) may be necessary for several reasons:\n\nIncrease predictive performance: The impact of uninformative features on a model’s predictions generally depends on the model type. While neural networks are typically very sensitive to irrelevant features, tree-based models should be able to simply ignore them. In practice though, their performance usually suffers at least to some degree too. Thus, dropping features is often a way to get better predictions.\nEasier data collection: Depending on the problem setting, good features that can be easily collected can be better than great features that are expensive to acquire. This may actually be quite important in practice.\nReduce computation/memory requirements: Reduce the size of the feature set in order to consume less memory and/or speed up training and inference.\nIncrease interpretability: There is a trade-off between predictive performance and model interpretability. If interpretability matters it may be our goal to find a set of interpretable features with reasonable predictive performance.\n\nSo how should we select our features? In theory, the best approach to feature selection is simple: just try out all combinations and pick the feature set that fits the requirements best. In practice, this is of course computationally infeasible. Thus, many feature selection methods have been proposed. They generally fall into three main classes:\n\nIntrinsic/Embedded methods: Intrinsic feature selection happens implicitly when the model is fitted. Thus, they don’t require any additional tools and build on a direct link between the objective function and feature selection. A common example are regularization models like lasso regression that force some predictors to be excluded from the model. Implicit feature selection also happens in tree-based models where predictors that are not used in any split are excluded from the model.\nFilter methods: Filter methods select features based on their properties (i.e., they don’t involve a model). For instance, common criteria are based on correlation with the target, mutual information or variance thresholds. The advantage of filter methods is that they are simple, fast and easily understandable.\nWrapper methods: Wrapper methods iteratively fit a model to a feature subset and use the resulting model performance to select the subset for the next iteration. They have the best chance of finding the most predictive features, but are computationally demanding (and in some cases simply infeasible). Common wrapper methods are:\n\nRecursive feature elimination (RFE): Create an initial model using all available features. Eliminate the least important features (e.g., features with the smallest coefficients when using a linear model). Fit the model on the reduced set of features. Repeat until the desired number of features has been reached.\nSequential feature selection (SFS):\n\nSequential forward selection: Begin with zero features. Fit a model for each available feature. Keep the feature that resulted in the best model performance. Repeat until the desired number of features has been reached.\nSequential backward selection: Begin with all \\(n\\) available features. Fit a model to all subsets of size \\(n-1\\). Keep the feature that is associated with highest drop in performance. Repeat until the desired number of features has been reached.\n\nGenetic algorithms: Genetic algorithms can be used effectively for feature selection.\nPermutation importance: Fit a model to all features. Then, for each feature, shuffle the feature column and score the predictions of the model. The higher the drop in performance, the more important is the feature. Rank the features by their permutation importance and select the desired number of features.\nSHAP: SHAP is a model-agnostic method for explaining individual predictions that has its roots in Shapley values from cooperative game theory. (See here and here for more on SHAP.) A great method for interpretable ML, it can be used effectively for computing feature importances (and thus feature selection) as well. For each feature we simply average the absolute values across the data to obtain global feature importances or we analyze a summary plot that visualizes the feature importances and effects for all instances. Note that SHAP values can be computed using GPU acceleration from inside XGBoost (just set pred_contribs=True when using model.predict()) which provides massive speed-ups. It is therefore easy to compute SHAP values as a default in a modeling pipeline. (Of course, we shouldn’t trust feature importance scores blindly because they can reflect bias in the data. In this case, it can be necessary to remove “important” features!)\n\n\nWhich of these methods is best suited for a given problem depends on many factors (number of features, resource constraints, etc.). However, note that the methods outlined above generally imply that feature selection is a separate step that comes after feature engineering. In practice, this may not be ideal. At least in situations when we don’t want to create large numbers of features automatically, we can proceed with feature engineering and feature selection in parallel. That is, we immediately try a newly created feature and keep it if the model improves in cross-validation. (In order to know whether the improvement is large enough, we should check the variation of the validation score between folds and/or seeds. The improvement should exceed this variation. Also, keep an eye on the train and the CV score. Adding a new feature shouldn’t widen the gap between both scores significantly; otherwise we are probably overfitting.) This approach can make feature engineering more natural (even more so if combined with analyzing SHAP values), allowing us to find suitable directions for improvement and understand the problem more thoroughly."

This makes intuitive sense.\nAt least without further feature engineering, the x and z position of the players, the players’ x velocity, and the boost timer features are not really useful for the model.\n\nLet’s see how the model performs when we drop the least important features.\n\n\nCode\noriginal_features = [f for f in original_features if f not in list(filter(re.compile(\"p[0-5]_pos_x\").match, original_features))]\noriginal_features = [f for f in original_features if f not in list(filter(re.compile(\"p[0-5]_pos_z\").match, original_features))]\noriginal_features = [f for f in original_features if f not in list(filter(re.compile(\"p[0-5]_vel_x\").match, original_features))]\noriginal_features = [f for f in original_features if \"timer\" not in f]\n\n\n\n\nCode\nshap_values = run_cv(train_df, original_features)\n\n\n[0] train-logloss:0.68522   valid-logloss:0.68526\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18868   valid-logloss:0.19893\nFold 0 score: 0.19893\n[0] train-logloss:0.68523   valid-logloss:0.68524\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18938   valid-logloss:0.19656\nFold 1 score: 0.19656\n[0] train-logloss:0.68524   valid-logloss:0.68522\n[999]   train-logloss:0.19023   valid-logloss:0.19323\nFold 2 score: 0.19323\n[0] train-logloss:0.68524   valid-logloss:0.68522\n[999]   train-logloss:0.19036   valid-logloss:0.19230\nFold 3 score: 0.19230\n[0] train-logloss:0.68524   valid-logloss:0.68523\n[999]   train-logloss:0.19029   valid-logloss:0.19292\nFold 4 score: 0.19292\nCV score: 0.19479\n\n\nAs expected, the CV score doesn’t deteriorate (it actually improves slightly).\nLet’s move on and engineer some new features. Judging from the Shap values and our understanding of the dataset, the y position of the ball is a very important feature. So let’s build on this and compute the Euclidean distance of the ball to the goal of team B as well as the relative distance:\n\n\nCode\ndef euclidean_dist(a, b):\n    return cupy.linalg.norm(a - b, axis=1)\n\ndef distance_ball_goal(df):\n    ball_pos = df[[f\"ball_pos_{c}\" for c in [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]]]\n    df[\"dist_ball2goalA\"] = euclidean_dist(ball_pos.values, cupy.array([0, 100, 6])).astype(\"float32\")\n    df[\"dist_ball2goalB\"] = euclidean_dist(ball_pos.values, cupy.array([0, -100, 6])).astype(\"float32\")\n    df[\"dist_ball2goal_A_rel_B\"] = (df[\"dist_ball2goalA\"] / df[\"dist_ball2goalB\"]).astype(\"float32\")\n    return df\n\ndef compute_features(df):\n    df = distance_ball_goal(df)\n    return df\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntrain_df = compute_features(train_df)\ntest_df = compute_features(test_df)\n\ndist_ball_goal_features = [\"dist_ball2goalB\", \"dist_ball2goal_A_rel_B\"]\nfeatures = original_features + dist_ball_goal_features\n\n\n\n\nCode\nshap_values = run_cv(train_df, features)\n\n\n[0] train-logloss:0.68520   valid-logloss:0.68524\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18855   valid-logloss:0.19880\nFold 0 score: 0.19880\n[0] train-logloss:0.68521   valid-logloss:0.68522\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18927   valid-logloss:0.19633\nFold 1 score: 0.19633\n[0] train-logloss:0.68522   valid-logloss:0.68520\n[999]   train-logloss:0.19008   valid-logloss:0.19306\nFold 2 score: 0.19306\n[0] train-logloss:0.68522   valid-logloss:0.68520\n[999]   train-logloss:0.19019   valid-logloss:0.19197\nFold 3 score: 0.19197\n[0] train-logloss:0.68522   valid-logloss:0.68521\n[999]   train-logloss:0.19006   valid-logloss:0.19265\nFold 4 score: 0.19265\nCV score: 0.19456\n\n\n\n\nCode\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values[:, :-1], features, plot_type=\"bar\", max_display=70, plot_size=(7, 8))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CV score has improved (a little bit) and the relative distance is now the most important feature. Apparently, distance features can be quite useful for this dataset. What next? Intuitively, the distance of the players to the ball indicates which team is in possession. Let’s compute the minimum and mean distance for both teams as well as the corresponding relative features:\n\n\nCode\ndef distance_team_ball(df):\n    ball_pos = df[[f\"ball_pos_{c}\" for c in [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]]]\n    \n    for p in range(6):\n        player_pos = df[[f\"p{p}_pos_{c}\" for c in [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]]]\n        player_pos.fillna(-10000, inplace=True)\n        df[f\"dist_p{p}_2ball\"] = euclidean_dist(player_pos.values, ball_pos.values).astype(\"float32\")\n        df[f\"dist_p{p}_2ball\"].loc[df[f\"dist_p{p}_2ball\"] &gt; 300] = np.nan\n        del player_pos\n        gc.collect()\n    \n    df[\"dist_team2ball_A_min\"] = df[[f\"dist_p{p}_2ball\" for p in range(3)]].min(axis=1)\n    df[\"dist_team2ball_B_min\"] = df[[f\"dist_p{p}_2ball\" for p in range(3, 6)]].min(axis=1)\n    df[\"dist_team2ball_A_mean\"] = df[[f\"dist_p{p}_2ball\" for p in range(3)]].mean(axis=1)\n    df[\"dist_team2ball_B_mean\"] = df[[f\"dist_p{p}_2ball\" for p in range(3, 6)]].mean(axis=1)\n    df[\"dist_team2ball_min_A_rel_B\"] = df[\"dist_team2ball_A_min\"] / df[\"dist_team2ball_B_min\"]\n    df[\"dist_team2ball_mean_A_rel_B\"] = df[\"dist_team2ball_A_mean\"] / df[\"dist_team2ball_B_mean\"]\n    \n    return df\n\ndef compute_features(df):\n    df = distance_ball_goal(df)\n    df = distance_team_ball(df)\n    return df\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntrain_df = compute_features(train_df)\ntest_df = compute_features(test_df)\n\ndist_team_ball_features = [\"dist_team2ball_A_min\", \"dist_team2ball_A_mean\", \"dist_team2ball_min_A_rel_B\", \"dist_team2ball_mean_A_rel_B\"]\nfeatures += dist_team_ball_features\n\n\nThe as_gpu_matrix method will be removed in a future cuDF release.

Consider using `to_cupy` instead.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nshap_values = run_cv(train_df, features)\n\n\n[0] train-logloss:0.68518   valid-logloss:0.68522\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18763   valid-logloss:0.19730\nFold 0 score: 0.19730\n[0] train-logloss:0.68520   valid-logloss:0.68521\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18830   valid-logloss:0.19456\nFold 1 score: 0.19456\n[0] train-logloss:0.68520   valid-logloss:0.68519\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18916   valid-logloss:0.19151\nFold 2 score: 0.19151\n[0] train-logloss:0.68521   valid-logloss:0.68519\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18930   valid-logloss:0.19056\nFold 3 score: 0.19056\n[0] train-logloss:0.68520   valid-logloss:0.68520\n[999]   train-logloss:0.18917   valid-logloss:0.19120\nFold 4 score: 0.19120\nCV score: 0.19302\n\n\n\n\nCode\nshap.summary_plot(shap_values[:, :-1], features, plot_type=\"bar\", max_display=70, plot_size=(7, 8))\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s yet another improvement of the CV score.\nThere are endless potential avenues for feature engineering left: we could add features related to missing players, try to leverage angles computed for the movement of the players and the ball in relation to each other and the goal, extrapolate the position of the ball based on its velocity vector, make more out of the boost timers (maybe link them to the position of the players), experiment with binning to see whether the high precision really is useful, etc. For the sake of brevity, though, we’ll call it a day.\nIn the next and final post, we’ll try to improve our model further with hyperparameter optimization."

    "section": "GBDT libraries and their hyperparameters",
    "text": "GBDT libraries and their hyperparameters\nFor the sake of brevity, we’ll only dive deeper into GBDTs and their hyperparameters. We’ll look at the most common implementations: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and scikit-learn’s HistGradientBoosting.\nNote:\n\nKnowing how GBDTs work is a prequisite for understanding their hyperparameters; see here for a thorough explanation.\nThe tips below come from my own experience (especially XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as what I gathered from other people’s code (CatBoost, HistGradientBoosting).\n\n\nXGBoost\nXGBoost was the first library that provided a highly optimized implementation of GBDTs. Nowadays, it is primarily developed by Nvidia leading to built-in GPU acceleration which massively speeds up model training.\nLet’s have a look at the most important hyperparameters:\n\nn_estimators: This is the number of trees fitted (which is equal to the number of boosting iterations). Generally a higher number of trees improves the model’s performance (at least up to some point), but also increases the risk of overfitting. In general, around 1,000 trees should be enough; using many more is not needed in most problem settings (5,000 should definitely be enough). Important: n_estimators has to be tuned in conjunction with the learning_rate. Thus, a good approach can be to set n_estimators=1000 and try out different learning rates (or do a grid search) before proceeding with tuning other hyperparameters. After finding a good hyperparameter setting, we can still tune both the number of trees and the learning rate. (Note that this can be done the other way around, too. That is, we can set the learning rate so that around 1,000 trees are used, and continue from there.)\nlearning_rate: A learning rate between 0.001 and 0.1 should work fine. Generally, a lower learning rate should be combined with a higher number of trees.\nmax_depth: Apart from n_estimators and learning_rate, max_depth is probably the most important hyperparameter. It determines the maximum depth of the trees; with a higher max_depth the model becomes more complex but also more likely to overfit. When tuning by hand, this is the first hyperparameter (after the number of trees/learning rate) that should be tuned. It is also the first parameter to decrease if overfitting is a problem. In general, a value between 3 and 10 should be fine. Depending on the problem, it can make sense to go a bit higher. Note that a higher max_depth results in slower computation and higher memory usage.\nmin_child_weight: Technically, min_child_weight is the minimum sum of instance weight needed in a child. In lay terms it regularizes the model by limiting the depth of the trees. Generally, a higher min_child_weight means a more conservative model. A good range for tuning is between 1 (the default value) and 300.\ncolsample_bytree: This is the subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree. Subsampling columns when constructing each tree can make the training faster and more robust to noise. Typically, the best value is between 0.5 and 0.9 (or even 0.3 and 1.0).\nsubsample: This is the subsample ratio of the training instances (subsampling occurs once in every boosting iteration). Like colsample_bytree, using subsample helps prevent overfitting by introducing randomness in the training process. Typically, the best value is between 0.5 and 0.8 (or even 0.4 and 1.0). 0.7 is often a good starting point. Making use of colsample_bytree and subsample leads to more different tree splits.\nreg_alpha, reg_lambda: While alpha represents the L1 regularization term on weights, lambda is the L2 regularization term. Increasing these hyperparameters translates to making the model more conservative. There are two things to note: First, adding regularization is not always better. Second, for GBDTs it tends to be better to set alpha to (near) zero, while using a higher lambda. A good range for tuning is between 0.001 and 10.0.\nmax_bin: The maximum number of bins to bucket numerical features. The default is 256. Can be increased to build a more complex model, but comes with a higher risk of overfitting and slows down training.\ngamma: gamma represents the minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. That is, gamma controls the complexity of the model and can be increased to combat overfitting. Since a good value for gamma is highly dependent on the data set and the other hyperparameters, it is difficult to give a good range for tuning. As per this post, it can help to increase gamma (the default is 0; try 3, 5, or 10, for example) if overfitting appears to be a huge problem. Values around 20 should only be used when the model uses a high max_depth.\n\nApart from n_estimators and learning_rate, it is typically enough to tune max_depth, min_child_weight, colsample_bytree, subsample, and reg_alpha/reg_lambda.\nNotes:\n\nThe XGBoost library provides two APIs: its original “Learning API” and a scikit-learn wrapper interface, the “Scikit-Learn API”. Furthermore, XGBoost uses the custom data structure DMatrix to improve training speed and memory efficiency. For improved memory efficiency when training on the GPU the XGBoost library also provides the DeviceQuantileDMatrix.\nSet objective to define the objective function and eval_metric for the evaluation metric. XGBoost provides many options for regression, classification, and ranking tasks. See here for defining custom objectives or evaluation metrics.\nSpecify the tree_method as gpu_hist to use GPU acceleration. XGBoost supports fully distributed GPU training using Dask.\nSpecify the predictor parameter to cpu_predictor to predict on the CPU or to gpu_predictor for using GPU accelerated prediction. Use gpu_predictor to compute SHAP values using GPU acceleration.\nWhen there are unbalanced classes, use scale_pos_weight to control the balance of positive and negative weights. A typical value is sum(negative instances) / sum(positive instances). See here for more tips and here for an example.\nDepending on the problem, we may know that a given feature should generally have a positive or negative effect on the target (e.g., due to business constraints or scientific knowledge) or we may want to restrict the interaction of different features. XGBoost provides tutorials on using monotonic constraints and feature interaction constraints.\nThere is experimental support for multi-output regression.\nThe integration with Apache Spark and Dask allows to handle huge volumes of data.\nThere is a callback for Weights & Biases.\n\n\n\nLightGBM\nLightGBM, developed by Microsoft, is an alternative to XGBoost. While XGBoost uses a level-wise strategy to grow trees (i.e., breadth-first search), LightGBM uses a leaf-wise growth strategy (i.e., depth-first search). This generally allows LightGBM to fit more quickly than XGBoost (at least when compared on CPUs).\n\nn_estimators: In LightGBM the optimal range for the number of trees appears to be somewhat wider than in XGBoost. Try values between 100 and 10,000. Increase the learning_rate when you decrease n_estimators. Note that choosing the right values for the number of trees and the learning rate is highly dependent on the data and the objective.\nlearning_rate: Try values between 0.001 and 0.1. Use a small learning rate combined with a higher number of iterations to improve the accuracy of the model. Decrease the learning rate to combat overfitting.\nmax_depth: Try values between 3 and 20.\nnum_leaves: The maximum number of final leaves for each tree and the main parameter to control the complexity of a LightGBM model. Can be between 2 and \\(2^{\\text{max depth}}\\).\nmin_data_in_leaf: The minimum number of data points in one leaf. Very important parameter to prevent overfitting in a leaf-wise tree (like LightGBM). Its optimal value depends on the number of training samples and num_leaves. Setting it to a large value can avoid growing too deep trees, but may cause underfitting. In practice, setting it to hundreds or thousands is enough for a large dataset.\nmax_bin: The maximum of bins that each feature will be bucketed into. The default is 255. Increasing max_bin up to, say, 400 allows more complexity but also increases the risk of overfitting. Decreasing max_bin can be used to speed up training.\ncolsample_bytree: Try values between 0.3 and 1.0.\nsubsample: Try values between 0.1 and 1.0.\nsubsample_freq: The frequency (in terms of boosting iterations) at which LightGBM will subsample the training examples. If subsampling helps, try values between 1 and 10.\nreg_alpha, reg_lambda: These are the same as in XGBoost.\nmin_gain_to_split: Increase min_gain_to_split to combat overfitting. From the LightGBM docs: “When adding a new tree node, LightGBM chooses the split point that has the largest gain. Gain is basically the reduction in training loss that results from adding a split point. By default, LightGBM sets min_gain_to_split to 0.0, which means ‘there is no improvement that is too small’. However, in practice you might find that very small improvements in the training loss don’t have a meaningful impact on the generalization error of the model.”\n\nApart from n_estimators and learning_rate, it is typically enough to tune num_leaves, min_data_in_leaf, colsample_bytree, subsample, and reg_alpha/reg_lambda.\nNotes:\n\nLightGBM provides two main APIs: the original “Training API” and a scikit-learn wrapper interface, the “Scikit-Learn API”.\nUse the Dataset class to handle data with LightGBM.\nIt is possible to train LightGBM using GPUs. XGBoost, however, generally provides (much) better GPU acceleration.\nSet objective to define the objective function. See here for the many options provided by LightGBM.\nUse categorical_feature to specify categorical features.\nIn binary classification, use is_unbalance or scale_pos_weight to handle class imbalances. In multi-class classification tasks, use class_weight. Per the LightGBM docs, note that it may be necessary to calibrate the resulting class probabilities.\nSince version 3.2.0 there is an integration with Dask.\nUse monotone_constraints to set monotonic constraints.\nThere is a callback for Weights & Biases.\n\n\n\nCatBoost\nCatBoost was originally developed by Yandex. As hinted by its name, CatBoost generally shines in datasets with many categorical features (CatBoost cleverly uses one-hot encoding and target encoding for this purpose). It can work really well with all kinds of datasets, however.\nThe eight most important hyperparameters:\n\nn_estimators: Try values between 100 and 1,000. CatBoost’s default is 1,000 trees; again, using many more typically isn’t necessary.\nlearning_rate: Try values between 0.001 and 0.1. Use a small learning rate combined with a higher number of iterations to improve the accuracy of the model. Decrease the learning rate to combat overfitting.\nmax_depth: Per the CatBoost docs, the optimal depth ranges from 4 to 10 and values from 6 to 10 are recommended. CatBoost doesn’t support values higher than 16.\nsubsample: Try values between 0.1 and 1.0.\nbagging_temperature: Defines the settings of the Bayesian bootstrap which is used to assign random weights to objects. The default is 1.0. A higher value translates to more aggressive bagging. If set to 0.0, all weights are equal to 1.\nrandom_strength: Per the CatBoost docs, this parameter is used when selecting splits: “On every iteration each possible split gets a score (for example, the score indicates how much adding this split will improve the loss function for the training dataset). The split with the highest score is selected. The scores have no randomness. A normally distributed random variable is added to the score of the feature. It has a zero mean and a variance that decreases during the training. The value of this parameter is the multiplier of the variance.” The default value is 1.0. Try values between 1e-9 and 10.0.\nborder_count: The number of splits for numerical features. 128 should usually be enough. Set border_count to the default of 254 when training on the GPU to get the best possible performance. Larger values are generally not recommended and slow down training.\nreg_lambda: Try values between 2 and 30.\n\nApart from n_estimators and learning_rate, it is typically enough to tune max_depth, subsample, reg_lambda, random_strength, and bagging_temperature.\nNotes:\n\nThe CatBoost API is compatible with scikit-learn.\nCatBoost models can be trained on the GPU (task_type=\"GPU\"). XGBoost, however, generally provides (much) better GPU acceleration.\nSee here for more on objective functions and metrics in CatBoost.\nUse cat_features to specify categorical features.\nUse class_weights to specify class weights in classification problems.\n\n\n\nHistGradientBoosting\nInspired by LightGBM, scikit-learn has added its own versions of GBDTs: HistGradientBoostingRegressor and HistGradientBoostingClassifier. They have less hyperparameters than the other implementations and are well worth a try.\n\nmax_iter: This is the maximum number of trees fitted (i.e., equivalent to n_estimators in other libraries). The default value is 100. Try values between 100 and 10,000.\nlearning_rate: Try values between 0.001 and 0.1.\nmax_depth: Try values between 3 and 12 (the ideal value is often around 6). Note that the depth isn’t constrained by default.\nmax_leaf_nodes: The maximum number of leaves for each tree. The default is 31. Depending on the dataset, try values in a larger range (e.g., between 2 and 500).\nmin_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples per leaf. The default is 20. Depending on the dataset, try values between 2 and 300.\nmax_bins: The default is 255 (one more bin is always reserved for missing values). Using less bins can help prevent overfitting, but isn’t generally recommended by scikit-learn.\nl2_regularization: Comparable to reg_lambda in other libraries. The default is 0. Try values up to 100.\n\nNotes:\n\nUse the loss parameter to set the loss function.\nScikit-learn provides an example for using monotonic constraints (set the monotonic_cst parameter). Setting interaction constraints is possible too (set the interaction_cst parameter).\nUse the categorical_features parameter to indicate categorical features.\nBy default, early stopping is performed if there are at least 10,000 samples. We can control this behavior using the early_stopping parameter."

    "text": "Hyperparameter Optimization\nFinding the right set of hyperparameters for a given problem can be very challenging. The automatic hyperparameter optimization methods that are briefly outlined below can generally be applied to any problems or models, not just tabular ones. Note: Before we can optimize hyperparameters, we of course need a model, a hyperparameter search space (i.e., a range of values for each hyperparameter), and a reliable CV scheme with an evaluation metric that we care about.\n\nGrid search: Grid search translates to searching exhaustively through all possible hyperparameter combinations. The algorithm is highly parallelizable, but naturally suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore not feasible in a high-dimensional search space. We can use it in the rare cases that don’t require a lot of tuning, though. Grid search is implemented by scikit-learn’s GridSearchCV.\nRandom search: Instead of trying every combinations, random search randomly samples the search space. Since this is generally feasible in high-dimensional spaces, doesn’t waste time with testing slightly different combinations, and still has a good chance of finding a good set of hyperparameters, random search is quite common in practice. It is implemented in scikit-learn’s RandomizedSearchCV.\nHalving search: Both grid search and random search cannot recognize ineffective hyperparameters or search intervals. To remedy this, scikit-learn also provides hyperparameter optimization based on successive halving (SH). In the first iteration, the SH algorithm evaluates all parameter combinations with a small amount of resources (often the number of training samples). Then, it selects only the best candidates for the next iteration which in turn uses more resources for evaluation. This process continues in the following iterations (i.e., only a subset of candidates proceeds to the next round and the corresponding performance estimates get more precise since more resources are allocated for evaluation). Scikit-learn implements the SH algorithm in HalvingGridSearchCV and HalvingRandomSearchCV.\nBayesian optimization: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a more sophisticated approach. Unlike grid search or random search, BO optimizes a surrogate function instead of the true objective function (because the true objective function may be expensive to evaluate, noisy, and evaluation doen’t give gradient information). In the beginning BO focuses on exploration to train the surrogate function, and then starts to exploit its approximate knowledge of the objective to sample more useful examples (i.e., hyperparameter combinations). For smooth search spaces, BO is typically based on Gaussian processes (with scikit-optimize being the most prominent example). An alternative for more complex search spaces are Tree Parzen Estimators (TPEs) which sample parameter combinations from a multivariate probability distribution. TPE is the default sampler used by Optuna, a widely used tool for hyperparameter optimization. See here for a nice and more in-depth explanation of Bayesian optimization.\n\nFinally, some general tips for GBDT hyperparameter tuning:\n\nFocus on key hyperparameters. It isn’t necessary to tune all available hyperparameters; instead focus on key hyperparameters that can be tuned intuitively.\nStay conservative. Using huge search spaces for finding the best possible hyperparameter configuration usually results in overfitting to the validation data. Thus, blindly trusting the result of an Optuna study is generally not a good idea (we need to at least check the best trials for consistency).\nDon’t tune the hyperparameters too often. After the hyperparameters of a model have been tuned, the results cannot be reliably compared to older runs. Tune the hyperparameters of the model when the feature engineering is complete (and maybe once when a useful basic set of features has been created).\nDon’t use early stopping. Instead of using a different number of trees for each fold (inevitably leading to overfitting), select the number of trees that works best across folds. We generally wouldn’t use different hyperparameters for our folds; this applies to the number of trees too. Also, using early stopping complicates retraining on the full dataset.\nWith some experience, tuning GBDTs manually can be a quite intuitive method for hyperparameter optimization (and get better results in less trials than Optuna). An example for XGBoost: Set n_estimators=1000 and choose an adequate learning rate. Then, try some reasonable values for max_depth and plot the corresponding CV scores (we should be able to see whether we need to try more values). Proceed like this with min_child_weight, colsample_bytree, subsample, and reg_alpha/reg_lambda. This way, we’ll gather a better understanding of the role of each hyperparameter. In the end, see whether changes to the number of trees and/or the learning rate can lead to further improvements."

    "text": "Monte Carlo Prediction\n\nMonte Carlo Estimation of State Values\nMC prediction of the state-value function of a given policy is pretty straightforward. Recall that the value of a state \\(s\\) under policy \\(\\pi\\), \\(v_{\\pi}(s)\\), is the expected return starting from that state. MC methods estimate \\(v_{\\pi}(s)\\) by simply averaging the returns observed in sample episodes after visits to that state. That is, we sample complete episodes \\(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, \\dots, R_T, S_T \\sim \\pi\\), calculate the return \\(G_t\\) for all states encountered and finally estimate the value function by averaging the returns obtained from each state \\(s\\). By the law of large numbers, this empirical mean converges to the expected value of \\(s\\) as the number of visits to \\(s\\) goes to infinity.\nSince \\(s\\) may be visited multiple times in the same episode, we can define two slightly different algorithms: first-visit MC prediction (also called first-visit MC policy evaluation) which estimates \\(v_{\\pi}(s)\\) by averaging only the returns following first visits to \\(s\\), and every-visit MC prediction (every-visit MC policy evaluation) which averages the returns following all visits to state \\(s\\).\nA naive implementation of first-visit MC prediction should make the idea clear. For each state \\(s\\) we could keep a counter \\(N(S_t)\\) and the total observed return \\(T(S_t)\\), both persisting over all sampled episodes. At the first time step \\(t\\) that state \\(S_t\\) is visited in an episode, we increment the counter by \\(1\\) and the total return by the observed return \\(G_t\\): \\[N(S_t) \\leftarrow N(S_t) + 1\\] \\[T(S_t) \\leftarrow T(S_t) + G_t\\] Then, we can estimate the value \\(V(s)\\) by computing the mean return: \\[V(S_t) = \\dfrac{T(S_t)}{N(S_t)}\\]\nBy the law of large numbers, \\(V(s) \\rightarrow v_{\\pi}(s)\\) as \\(N(s) \\rightarrow \\infty\\). The implementation of every-visit MC prediction is nearly equivalent, we simply increment the counter and the total return every time \\(s\\) is visited in an episode instead.\nHowever, this computation is of course quite inefficient. What we can do instead is update the value estimates incrementally after each episode which is equivalent:\n\\[V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\dfrac{1}{N(S_t)}(G_t - V(S_t)),\\]\nwhere \\(G_t\\) is called the MC target and \\((G_t - V(S_t))\\) the MC error. Intuitively, after each sampled episode we improve our estimate of the value function by taking a small step in the direction of the observed target.\nNote that in non-stationary problems we might prefer to track a running mean by using a constant step-size \\(\\alpha\\). This allows us to “forget” old episodes:\n\\[V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\alpha (G_t - V(S_t))\\]\n\n\nCode\ndef decay(decay_ratio, start_val, min_val, max_steps, log_start=-2, log_base=10):\n    decay_steps = int(max_steps * decay_ratio)\n    values = np.logspace(log_start, 0, decay_steps, base=log_base, endpoint=True)[::-1]\n    values = (values - values.min()) / (values.max() - values.min())\n    values = (start_val - min_val) * values + min_val\n    values = np.pad(values, (0, max_steps - decay_steps), 'edge')\n    return values\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef sample_trajectory(env, pi, max_steps=200):\n    done = False\n    trajectory = []\n    \n    while not done:\n        state = env.reset()\n        \n        for t in count():\n            action = pi[state]\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            trajectory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))\n            if done:\n                break\n            if t &gt;= max_steps - 1:\n                trajectory = []\n                break\n            state = next_state\n    \n    return np.array(trajectory, dtype=\"object\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef mc_prediction(env, pi, gamma=1., n_episodes=1000, max_steps=200, first_visit=True, start_alpha=0.5, min_alpha=0.01, alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    n_states = env.observation_space.n\n    value = np.zeros(n_states)\n    discounts = np.power(gamma, np.arange(max_steps))\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        trajectory = sample_trajectory(env, pi, max_steps)\n        visited = np.zeros(n_states, dtype=\"bool\")\n        \n        for t, (state, _, reward, _, _) in enumerate(trajectory):\n            if first_visit and visited[state]:\n                continue\n            visited[state] = True\n            n_steps = len(trajectory[t:])\n            G = np.sum(discounts[:n_steps] * trajectory[t:, 2])\n            value[state] += alphas[ep] * (G - value[state])\n    \n    return value\n\n\nLet’s have a look at our toy environment again and compute the state values using MC prediction.\n\n\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"FrozenLake4x4-v2\")\nenv.render()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npi_right = {state : 1 for state in range(env.prob.shape[0])}\nmc_val = mc_prediction(env, pi_right)\n\n\nIf we compared this to the state values computed by the policy evaluation algorithm, we would notice that we merely got an approximation. Still, the results look good:\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(values=mc_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonte Carlo Estimation of Action Values\nWithout a model of the environment, state-values are not sufficient to determine a policy (how would we know which action to take in each state?). Hence, we must estimate the action-value function \\(q_{\\pi}(s)\\) in order to tackle the control problem. Fortunately, MC estimation of action values is basically the same as for state values. We just need to consider visits to state-action pairs instead of states (a state-action pair \\(s,a\\) means being in state \\(s\\) and taking action \\(a\\)). The first-visit MC method averages the returns following the first visit per episode of a state-action pair, while the every-visit MC method averages over all visits of a state-action pair.\n\\[N(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow N(S_t, A_t) + 1\\]\n\\[Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\dfrac{1}{N(S_t, A_t)} (G_t - Q(S_t, A_t))\\]\nBoth methods are guaranteed to converge to the true expected values as the number of visits to each state-action pair goes to infinity. This poses an important challenge, though. It is not guaranteed (unlikely in fact) that the sampled trajectories cover the entire state and action space, yet we need solid estimates of all alternatives in order to know which action is the best in each state. Put differently, we need to gather experience with all available states and actions, and not only the ones we visit when following our current policy. The good news is that this is not uncharted territory for us. With the \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy action selection strategy we have already introduced a simple and yet very useful method to balance our need for both exploration and exploitation. Let’s see how it fits into MC control."

    "text": "Monte Carlo Control\nRecall the pattern of generalized policy iteration (GPI) that we introduced in the last chapter on DP methods. GPI consists of two processes: estimating the value function of a given policy (policy evaluation) and improving the policy by making it greedy with respect to the value function (policy improvement). Alternating between these steps ultimately leads to the optimal policy and the optimal value function.\nHow can we use this pattern with MC methods where we don’t have complete knowledge of the MDP? As we already mentioned above, there are two changes to make. First, we need to estimate action-values instead of state-values since we otherwise wouldn’t know which action we should take in each state. We therefore use first-visit MC prediction of action values in the policy evaluation phase. Second, we need to explore the entire state and action space since we otherwise wouldn’t know whether there are more valuable states and actions than those that we visit under our current policy. This is why we use the \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy strategy to select actions in the policy improvement phase. We still take the greedy action most of time, but we also satisfy our need for exploration by randomly choosing an action with small probability \\(\\epsilon\\). Note that we should slowly decay \\(\\epsilon\\) towards zero in order to make sure that the algorithm can converge to a greedy policy in the end. This is called being Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration (GLIE) and guarantees convergence to the optimal policy.\n\n\nCode\ndef sample_trajectory(env, pi, q, epsilon, max_steps=200):\n    done = False\n    trajectory = []\n    \n    while not done:\n        state = env.reset()\n        \n        for t in count():\n            action = pi(state, q, epsilon)\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            trajectory.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))\n            if done:\n                break\n            if t &gt;= max_steps - 1:\n                trajectory = []\n                break\n            state = next_state\n    \n    return np.array(trajectory, dtype=\"object\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef mc_control(env, \n               gamma=1., \n               n_episodes=1000, \n               max_steps=200, \n               first_visit=True, \n               start_eps=1., \n               min_eps=0.1, \n               eps_decay_ratio=0.75, \n               start_alpha=0.5, \n               min_alpha=0.01, \n               alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    n_states, n_actions = env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n\n    discounts = np.power(gamma, np.arange(max_steps))\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    epsilons = decay(eps_decay_ratio, start_eps, min_eps, n_episodes)\n    \n    q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    \n    pi = lambda state, q, epsilon: np.argmax(q[state]) if np.random.random() &gt; epsilon else np.random.randint(len(q[state]))\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        trajectory = sample_trajectory(env, pi, q, epsilons[ep], max_steps)\n        visited = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions), dtype=\"bool\")\n        \n        for t, (state, action, reward, _, _) in enumerate(trajectory):\n            if first_visit and visited[state][action]:\n                continue\n            visited[state][action] = True\n            n_steps = len(trajectory[t:])\n            G = np.sum(discounts[:n_steps] * trajectory[t:, 2])\n            q[state][action] += alphas[ep] * (G - q[state][action])\n    \n    value = np.max(q, axis=1)\n    pi = np.argmax(q, axis=1)\n    \n    return value, pi\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"FrozenLake4x4-v2\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmc_val, mc_pi = mc_control(env, gamma=1., n_episodes=100000, max_steps=200, first_visit=True)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(values=mc_val, policy=mc_pi)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see MC methods can attain optimal behavior in an environment without having prior knowledge of its dynamics.

As we have noted before, having full access to the MDP is not realistic when we face more complex problems. Nonetheless, DP provides the theoretical underpinning for many RL algorithms that try to approximate optimal solutions without perfect knowledge of an environment’s dynamics and is therefore essential for working on RL problems.\nNote that we assume that we deal with a finite MDP. In particular, we assume that the state set \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), action set \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), and reward set \\(\\mathcal{R}\\) of the environment are all finite and that its dynamics are given by a set of probabilities \\(p(s', r \\ \\vert \\ s, a)\\), for all \\(s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\), \\(a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)\\), \\(r \\in \\mathcal{R}\\), and \\(s' \\in \\mathcal{S^+}\\).

Unfortunately, the corridor is slippery: the agent (starting in the middle) only moves in the intended direction with probability \\(1/2\\). With probability \\(1/3\\) the agent stays in the same state, and with probability \\(1/6\\) the agent trips and falls in the opposite direction.\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport gym\nimport gym_walk\nCode\nrng = np.random.default_rng(1)\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"SlipperyWalkFive-v0\")\nenv.render(show_step=False)\nIn LakeEnv the problem is essentially the same, but slightly more complex: the agent has to cross a frozen lake without falling into a hole. Again, the ice is slippery so that the agent only moves in the intended direction with probability \\(1/3\\).

Then, at each iteration \\(k\\), we compute a new approximation of each state-value by adding the expected immediate reward from that state and the estimated value of its successor state. This is called an expected update since it is based on an expectation over all possible transitions from that state. As \\(k\\) approaches infinity, the algorithm converges to the true values (in practice we simply stop updating when the updates become negligible).\nImportantly, at each iteration \\(k\\) we use an estimate from the previous iteration, \\(v_{k-1}(s')\\), to compute the new estimate \\(v_k(s)\\). Using an estimate when calculating an estimate is a technique called bootstrapping that commonly appears in RL.\n\nImplementation\nBefore we look at a possible implementation of the policy evaluation algorithm, we first need to introduce the transition probability matrix prob and the reward matrix reward.\n\n\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"SlipperyWalkFive-v0\")\nLEFT, RIGHT = 0, 1\nenv.render(show_step=False)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nwith np.printoptions(precision=3):\n    print(env.prob)\n\n\n[[[1.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.   ]\n  [1.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.   ]]\n\n [[0.5   0.333 0.167 0.    0.    0.    0.   ]\n  [0.167 0.333 0.5   0.    0.    0.    0.   ]]\n\n [[0.    0.5   0.333 0.167 0.    0.    0.   ]\n  [0.    0.167 0.333 0.5   0.    0.    0.   ]]\n\n [[0.    0.    0.5   0.333 0.167 0.    0.   ]\n  [0.    0.    0.167 0.333 0.5   0.    0.   ]]\n\n [[0.    0.    0.    0.5   0.333 0.167 0.   ]\n  [0.    0.    0.    0.167 0.333 0.5   0.   ]]\n\n [[0.    0.    0.    0.    0.5   0.333 0.167]\n  [0.    0.    0.    0.    0.167 0.333 0.5  ]]\n\n [[0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    1.   ]\n  [0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    0.    1.   ]]]\n\n\nThe transition probability matrix prob shows the transition probabilities depending on the current state and action. For example, suppose that the agent is currently in state \\(5\\) (the second state from the right). Look at the second row: if it chooses the action “RIGHT”, it will reach the rightmost state with probability \\(0.5\\), stay in the same state with probability \\(0.333\\), and trip and fall backwards with probability \\(0.167\\). Accordingly, the first row corresponds to the action “LEFT”:\n\n\nCode\nwith np.printoptions(precision=3):\n    print(env.prob[5])\n\n\n[[0.    0.    0.    0.    0.5   0.333 0.167]\n [0.    0.    0.    0.    0.167 0.333 0.5  ]]\n\n\nNow, suppose the agent fell into the hole (that is, it is in state \\(0\\), the leftmost state). Since this is a terminal state, the agent cannot leave it. Regardless of the action, the transition is always to the same state with probability \\(1.0\\).\n\n\nCode\nwith np.printoptions(precision=3):\n    print(env.prob[0])\n\n\n[[1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n\n\nThe transition probability matrix has the shape (n_states, n_actions, n_states). For every state it shows the transition probabilities to the next states depending on the action.\nThe reward matrix reward has the same shape. For every state it shows the potential rewards depending on the action. In our case, we use a very simple reward scheme. The agent gets reward \\(1.0\\) if it reaches the rightmost state. As we see below, this is only possible from state \\(5\\) where the agent can intentionally reach the goal by taking the action “RIGHT” or unintentionally by tripping and falling backward when choosing “LEFT”.\n\n\nCode\nwith np.printoptions(precision=3):\n    print(env.reward)\n\n\n[[[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n\n [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n\n [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n\n [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n\n [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]\n\n [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]\n  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1.]]\n\n [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]\n  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]]\n\n\nTogether prob and reward represent complete knowledge of the environment. We can now turn our attention to a possible implementation of the policy evaluation algorithm:\n\n\nCode\ndef policy_evaluation(pi, prob, reward, gamma=1., theta=1e-10):\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        pi (np.ndarray): policy;\n        prob (np.ndarray): transition probability matrix;\n        reward (np.ndarray): reward matrix;\n        gamma (float): discount factor;\n        theta (float): accuracy threshold;\n    \n    Returns:\n        value (np.ndarray): value function of the given policy;\n    \"\"\"\n    n_states, n_actions = prob.shape[0], prob.shape[1]\n    # Initialize the values to zero\n    value = np.zeros(n_states)\n    while True:\n        # Keep track of the old values\n        value_old = value.copy()\n        # Loop over all states\n        for state in range(n_states):\n            # Get the transition probabilities for the given state and action (as determined by the given policy)\n            prob_sa = prob[state, pi[state], :]\n            # Get the possible rewards for the given state and action\n            reward_sa = reward[state, pi[state], :]\n            # Perform the update (we'll look at this step in detail below)\n            value[state] = prob_sa.T.dot(reward_sa + gamma * value_old)\n        # Break the loop if the update is below the threshold theta\n        if np.all(np.abs(value - value_old) &lt; theta):\n            break\n    return value\n\n\nIt is probably wise to look at the update value[state] = prob_sa.T.dot(reward_sa + gamma * value_old) in isolation. What happens here? Let’s make up a simplified example. Suppose we are in state \\(0\\) and, following our policy, choose the action \\(1\\). First, we need to get the probabilities of all possible transitions by accessing prob[0, 1, :]. In our example that might simply be [0.5, 0.5], that is, state \\(0\\) and state \\(1\\) are the only possible next states and equally likely. Next we need the possible rewards. reward[0, 1, :] gives [2.0, 10.0], that is, we get the reward \\(2\\) when we stay in the same state \\(0\\) and reward \\(10\\) when we transition to state \\(1\\). Finally, suppose that our current value estimates are [1.0, 1.0] and we chose gamma = 1.0. Our update to the value of state \\(0\\) would look like this: \\(0.5 * (2.0 + 1.0 * 1.0) + 0.5 * (10.0 + 1.0 * 1.0)\\). To simplify this in the implementation above, we use the dot product (or inner product) operation.\nWe are now ready to apply the policy evaluation algorithm to our WalkEnv example. Let’s use it to compare the value functions of three policies: pi_left which chooses “LEFT” in every state, pi_right which chooses “RIGHT” every time (logically, this is the optimal policy in this example), and pi_random which randomly picks a direction in each step.\n\n\nCode\npi_left = {state : LEFT for state in range(env.prob.shape[0])}\npi_right = {state : RIGHT for state in range(env.prob.shape[0])}\npi_random = {state : rng.choice(env.prob.shape[1]) for state in range(env.prob.shape[0])}\npolicies = {\"pi_left\": pi_left, \"pi_right\": pi_right, \"pi_random\": pi_random}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfor pi_name, pi in policies.items():\n    print(f\"{pi_name}: \")\n    env.render(policy=pi)\n\n\npi_left: \n\n\n\n\n\npi_right: \n\n\n\n\n\npi_random: \n\n\n\n\n\nWe can now determine the corresponding value functions with the help of our policy_evaluation algorithm:\n\n\nCode\nfor pi_name, pi in policies.items():\n    value = policy_evaluation(pi, env.prob, env.reward)\n    with np.printoptions(precision=3):\n        print(f\"{pi_name}:\\t {value}\")\n\n\npi_left:     [0.    0.003 0.011 0.036 0.11  0.332 0.   ]\npi_right:    [0.    0.668 0.89  0.964 0.989 0.997 0.   ]\npi_random:   [0.    0.519 0.692 0.75  0.769 0.827 0.   ]\n\n\nAgain, it is probably easier to visualize the value functions.\n\n\nCode\nfor pi_name, pi in policies.items():\n    print(f\"{pi_name}: \")\n    env.render(policy=pi, values=policy_evaluation(pi, env.prob, env.reward))\n\n\npi_left: \n\n\n\n\n\npi_right: \n\n\n\n\n\npi_random:"

    "text": "Policy Improvement\nWith policy evaluation we now have an algorithm to evaluate policies. How can we use it to obtain better policies, a task that is typically referred to as the control problem? Imagine we have computed the value function for an arbitrary (deterministic) policy \\(\\pi\\) and look at a specific state \\(s\\). Since we know its value, we know how valuable it is to follow policy \\(\\pi\\) starting from this state. But is there actually an action \\(a \\neq \\pi(s)\\) we could select now which puts us in a better position (assuming we still follow policy \\(\\pi\\) afterwards)? To answer this question, we can use the state-value function \\(v_{\\pi}\\) and the known dynamics of the MDP to calculate the action-value function \\(q_{\\pi}\\). The Q-function will tell us how valuable every state-action is, and if, for a given state, there is an action that is more valuable than the action determined by policy \\(\\pi\\). Then improving our policy is straightforward: in every state we just act greedily with respect to the action-value function (i.e. choose the actions with the highest values) and thereby obtain a new, improved policy \\(\\pi'\\).\nThis algorithm is called policy improvement and, as the name suggests, guarantees to always find an improved policy \\(\\pi'\\) (unless, of course, the policy \\(\\pi\\) is already optimal). Let’s look at the math.\nFirst, we need to compute \\(q_{\\pi}(s,a)\\): \\[\n\\begin{align}\nq_{\\pi}(s,a) & = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma v_{\\pi} (S_{t+1})\\ \\vert\\ S_t = s, A_t = a \\right]\\\\\n             & = \\sum_{s', r} p(s', r \\vert s, a) \\left[ r + \\gamma v_{\\pi}(s') \\right]\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThen, we obtain the improved policy \\(\\pi'\\) by taking the highest-valued action in every state. Ties can be broken arbitrarily or, in the stochastic case, by assigning each action a specific probability (while assigning zero probability to all actions that are not maximal):\n\\[\\pi'(s) = \\text{argmax}_a\\ q_{\\pi}(s,a)\\]\n\nImplementation\n\n\nCode\ndef policy_improvement(value, prob, reward, gamma=1.):\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        value (np.ndarray): value function;\n        prob (np.ndarray): transition probability matrix;\n        reward (np.ndarray): reward matrix;\n        gamma (float): discount factor;\n    Returns:\n        pi (np.ndarray): policy;\n    \"\"\"\n    n_states, n_actions = prob.shape[0], prob.shape[1]\n    # Initialize the action-values to zero\n    q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    # Loop over all states\n    for state in range(n_states):\n        # Loop over all actions\n        for action in range(n_actions):\n            # Get the transition probabilities for the given state and action\n            prob_sa = prob[state, action, :]\n            # Get the rewards for the given state and action\n            reward_sa = reward[state, action, :]\n            # Determine the action-value\n            q[state][action] = prob_sa.T.dot(reward_sa + gamma * value)\n    # The improved policy uses the best available action in each state\n    pi = np.argmax(q, axis=1)\n    return pi\n\n\nLet’s say we want to improve the policy pi_left that we introduced above. We begin by computing the corresponding value function:\n\n\nCode\nvalue_pi_left = policy_evaluation(pi_left, env.prob, env.reward)\nenv.render(policy=pi_left, values=value_pi_left)\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can apply the policy_improvement algorithm:\n\n\nCode\nimproved_pi = policy_improvement(value_pi_left, env.prob, env.reward)\nenv.render(policy=improved_pi, values=policy_evaluation(improved_pi, env.prob, env.reward))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our small example, a single iteration of the policy improvement algorithm actually sufficed to obtain an optimal policy of always moving right (in this case, the optimal policy). But this is not guaranteed! Let’s look at a more complex example:\n\n\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"FrozenLake4x4-v2\")\nenv.render()\n\n\n\n\n\nTo say the least, the pi_left policy isn’t a particularly wise choice for this problem. Let’s see what happens when we apply our policy improvement algorithm:\n\n\nCode\npi_left = {state : LEFT for state in range(env.prob.shape[0])}\nvalue_pi_left = policy_evaluation(pi_left, env.prob, env.reward)\nenv.render(policy=pi_left, values=value_pi_left)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nimproved_pi = policy_improvement(value_pi_left, env.prob, env.reward)\nvalue_improved_pi = policy_evaluation(improved_pi, env.prob, env.reward)\nenv.render(policy=improved_pi, values=value_improved_pi)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new policy obtained by running policy improvement once is indeed better than the pi_left policy, but it is still far from optimal. What should we do now?"

Both processes essentially create a moving target for each other and only stabilize when an optimal policy and the optimal value function have been found. This general pattern is called generalized policy iteration (GPI). Policy iteration and value iteration, like most methods in RL, are only two specific realizations of this pattern: while we wait for the convergence of policy evaluation in each step of policy iteration, we merely perform a single update in value iteration. There are many other possible approaches: for example, doing multiple iterations of policy evaluation in between each step of policy improvement can lead to faster convergence. Also, it is possible to asynchronously update some states several times before updating other values once. This can help in problems with large state spaces, especially if there are many states that are very unlikely to occur (though all states must be updated in the long run to guarantee convergence).\nIn the next post, we’ll see how we can solve the RL problem without complete knowledge of the environment."

Your goal is to maximize your winnings in the long run by choosing the slot machine(s) with the highest reward probability.\nLet’s look at multi-armed bandits in RL terms: At each time step \\(t\\), the agent has a choice among \\(k\\) different actions. His reward \\(R_t\\) is chosen from a stationary probability distribution that depends on the selected action \\(A_t\\).

The goal of the agent is to maximize the cumulative reward \\(\\sum_{t=1}^{T} R_t\\) which is the same as to minimize the so-called regret (or loss), \\(\\mathcal{L_t}\\), due to not picking the optimal action\n\\[\\mathcal{L}_T = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left(v_* - q_*(A_t)\\right) \\right],\\]\nwhere \\(v_*\\) denotes the true value of the optimal action \\(a_*\\).\nAs we will see, this simplified version of the Markov decision process (MDP) is particularly suited to investigate the exploration vs. exploitation trade-off that arises in RL. Imagine you can choose between 10 slot machines and randomly select machine #5 to begin with. Say, you get the reward. Should you keep choosing machine #5? In RL, this is called exploitation: you choose the best option you know about. But since you’ve tried only one machine, there certainly could be another one that is better (that is, has a higher reward probability). To find out whether there in fact is, you must try other slot machines. This is called exploration since you explore other options to possibly find one that offers a higher reward probability than the ones you tried out before. Likely neither exploitation (only if your first choice is indeed the best) nor exploration (only if all choices are equally good) alone will suffice to maximize the cumulative reward. This is why agents must balance exploitation and exploration in order to reach their goal. Don’t forget that the stochasticity of the environment adds to the problem. While you got the reward when trying machine #5 for the first time, you may lose the second and third time you try it. This is why an agent needs a good strategy for reliably estimating the action-values by trial-and-error.\nNote: A general intro into the topic can be found here. For more on practical applications of multi-armed bandits, see here.\nLet’s put this in code. We’ll write a class Bandit that implements a multi-armed bandit with \\(k\\) arms where each arm has a given probability of returning the reward (this is known as a Bernoulli bandit).\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nCode\nrng = np.random.default_rng(7)\nCode\nclass Bandit:\n    def __init__(self, k, probs=None):\n        self.k = k\n        if probs is None:\n            self.probs = rng.random(self.k)\n        else:\n            self.probs = probs\n\n        self.best_prob = np.max(self.probs)\n        self.best_arm = np.argmax(self.probs)\n        self.sorted_arms = np.argsort(self.probs)\n\n    def gen_reward(self, k):\n        return rng.binomial(1, self.probs[k])\n    \n    def plot(self, highlight_best=False):\n        _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 3))\n\n        ax.plot(np.arange(0, self.k), self.probs, \"o\", color=\"black\", ms=5)\n        ax.grid(visible=True, which=\"both\", lw=0.3)\n        ax.set(ylim=(0, 1),\n               xticks=np.arange(self.k),\n               xlabel=\"Arms\",\n               ylabel=\"Reward probability\")\n        ax.tick_params(axis=\"y\", length=0)\n        for spine in [\"left\", \"right\"]:\n            ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n        if highlight_best:\n            x, y = self.best_arm, self.best_prob\n            ax.plot(x, y, \"o\", color=\"red\", fillstyle=\"none\", ms=10, zorder=2)\nLet’s look at our example bandit. The highlighted arm (#1 with the red circle) is the arm with the highest reward probability. Arms #5 and #7 come in second and third.\nCode\nbandit = Bandit(10)\nbandit.plot(highlight_best=True)\nCode\nlist(zip(bandit.sorted_arms, bandit.probs[bandit.sorted_arms]))[::-1]\n\n\n[(1, 0.8972138009695755),\n (5, 0.8735534453962619),\n (7, 0.8212284183827663),\n (8, 0.7970694287520462),\n (2, 0.7756856902451935),\n (0, 0.625095466604667),\n (9, 0.4679349528437208),\n (4, 0.30016628491122543),\n (3, 0.22520718999059186),\n (6, 0.005265304565574724)]"

    "text": "Action-value Methods\nUnsurprisingly, methods for estimating the values of actions are called action-value methods. Since the true value of an action is the mean reward the agent gets when selecting this action, the most obvious way to estimate this is the sample-average method which just averages the actually observed rewards for each action:\n\\[Q_t(a) = \\dfrac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} R_i \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{A_i=a}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \\mathbb{1}_{A_i=a}},\\]\nwhere \\(\\mathbb{1}\\) is a binary indicator function that is \\(1\\) if the corresponding expression is true and \\(0\\) otherwise. Put simply, we divide the sum of the rewards the agent has received so far for taking action \\(a\\) by the number of times he selected action \\(a\\). By the law of large numbers \\(Q_t(a)\\) converges to \\(q_*(a)\\) as the denominator goes to infinity. To avoid division by zero (when the agent hasn’t chosen action \\(a\\) yet), we need to define a default value for \\(Q_t(a)\\), say \\(0\\) for now.\nFor a specific action \\(a\\) this could be implemented like this:\n\\[Q_n = \\dfrac{R_1 + R_2 + \\dots + R_{n-1}}{n-1},\\]\nwhere \\(Q_n\\) denotes the action-value estimate after the action has been selected \\(n{-}1\\) times. The disadvantages of this implementation, however, are potentially huge requirements for memory (storing all the rewards) and computation (doing this calculation again and again). Thus, it is much more efficient to compute the estimates incrementally with a simple update rule that comes with constant computation per time step as well as constant memory (only for \\(Q_n\\) and \\(n\\)):\n\\[Q_{n+1} = Q_n + \\dfrac{1}{n} \\big[ R_n - Q_n \\big]\\]\nNote that the pattern of this update rule\n\\[\\text{NewEstimate} \\leftarrow \\text{OldEstimate} + \\text{StepSize} \\left[ \\text{Target} - \\text{OldEstimate} \\right]\\]\nwon’t occur here for the last time. To improve our estimate, we calculate the error \\(\\text{Target} - \\text{OldEstimate}\\) and try to reduce it by taking a step towards the target. The size of that step is determined by the step-size parameter \\(\\alpha_t(a)\\). In the simple algorithm presented above \\(\\alpha = \\dfrac{1}{n}\\)."

    "section": "Exploration Strategies",
    "text": "Exploration Strategies\nNow that we have a simple method for estimating action values, we can turn our attention to some classic exploration strategies. But first, let’s see why the pure exploitation and pure exploration strategies don’t work.\nAlways exploiting means always selecting the action with the highest estimated value (or one of the actions if there are multiple ones with the highest estimated value) and is called the greedy action selection method:\n\\[A_t = \\text{argmax}_{a} Q_t(a)\\]\nActions that appear to be inferior are never sampled under this strategy. Think back to the casino example one more time: Imagine you define the default values to be \\(0\\) for every slot machine, randomly select machine #5 and get the reward. Under a greedy strategy, you will always choose machine #5 from now on since it has the highest action-value estimate. Only if the estimate falls below zero, you will try out another machine. Thus, if there are no negative rewards in the environment the greedy method will always stick to the first action. It is obvious why this doesn’t guarantee the best long-term reward.\nThe other extreme, pure random exploration, is not a useful strategy either. You will get very good action-value estimates in the long run by sampling every option, but don’t use your knowledge to maximize your rewards. This is why you need to balance the gathering of information (exploration) and the use of information (exploitation) to reach your goal.\nLet’s see how this plays out with our example bandit. We define a Strategy class that allows us easily apply specific strategies to our problem.\n\n\nCode\nN_STEPS = 1000\n\nclass Strategy:\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=1000):\n        self.bandit = bandit\n        self.n_steps = n_steps\n\n        self.Q = np.zeros(self.bandit.k)\n        self.n = np.zeros(self.bandit.k, dtype=\"int\")\n\n        self.rewards = np.empty(self.n_steps, dtype=\"int\")\n        self.actions = np.empty(self.n_steps, dtype=\"int\")\n        self.regrets = np.empty(self.n_steps)\n\n    def step(self):\n        raise NotImplementedError\n    \n    def update(self, action, reward, t):\n        self.n[action] += 1\n        self.Q[action] += (reward - self.Q[action]) / self.n[action]\n        self.rewards[t] = reward\n        self.actions[t] = action\n        self.regrets[t] = self.bandit.best_prob - self.bandit.probs[action]\n\n    def run(self):\n        for t in range(self.n_steps):\n            action = self.step()\n            reward = self.bandit.gen_reward(action)\n            self.update(action, reward, t)\n    \n    def reset(self):\n        self.Q = np.zeros(self.bandit.k)\n        self.n = np.zeros(self.bandit.k, dtype=\"int\")\n        self.rewards = np.empty(self.n_steps, dtype=\"int\")\n        self.actions = np.empty(self.n_steps, dtype=\"int\")\n        self.regrets = np.empty(self.n_steps)\n    \n    def plot_actions(self):\n        _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 3))\n        ax.scatter(np.arange(self.n_steps), self.actions, c=\"black\", alpha=0.5)\n        ax.set(xticks=np.linspace(0, self.n_steps, 5),\n               yticks=np.arange(self.bandit.k),\n               xlabel=\"Steps\",\n               ylabel=\"Arms\")\n        ax.grid()\n\ndef plot_actions(strategy):\n    strategy.run()\n    strategy.plot_actions()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclass GreedyExploitation(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS):\n        super(GreedyExploitation, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n    \n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"PureExploitation\"\n    \n    def step(self):\n        if not np.any(self.Q):\n            return rng.integers(0, self.bandit.k)\n        else:\n            return np.argmax(self.Q)\n\n\nAs we can see below, the greedy strategy starts by picking a random action (arm #8 in this case). If, by chance, this arm returns the reward, the strategy will stay with this arm regardless of its reward probability. Otherwise the strategy would randomly choose arms until one returns the reward.\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(GreedyExploitation(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclass RandomExploration(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS):\n        super(RandomExploration, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return \"PureExploration\"\n\n    def step(self):\n        return rng.integers(0, self.bandit.k)\n\n\nThe random exploration strategy is the other extreme; it continues to explore all possible actions.\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(RandomExploration(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEpsilon-greedy Strategy\nA simple improvement of the naive greedy approach is to exploit most of the time, but, with small probability \\(\\epsilon\\), sometimes select an action randomly (i.e. independently of the action-value estimates), thereby exploring the other options. This strategy is called \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy and is guaranteed to converge to the true action-values, assuming that, in the limit, every action will be sampled an infinite number of times. \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy turns out to work surprisingly well in many problems.\n\n\nCode\nclass EpsilonGreedy(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS, epsilon=0.04):\n        super(EpsilonGreedy, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n        self.epsilon = epsilon\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"EpsilonGreedy, epsilon={self.epsilon}\"\n\n    def step(self):\n        if rng.random() &lt; self.epsilon:\n            return rng.integers(0, self.bandit.k)\n        else:\n            return np.argmax(self.Q)\n\n\n\\(\\epsilon\\) is a hyperparameter that we have to choose depending on the problem. In the example below with \\(\\epsilon=0.04\\), the epsilon-greedy strategy finds the best arm after around 600 steps.\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(EpsilonGreedy(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecaying Epsilon-greedy Strategy\nIntuitively, an agent’s need for exploration is high in the beginning when he doesn’t have much information about the environment yet, but gets progressively smaller because he improves his value estimations as he gets more and more experience. This intuition can be implemented into the \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy strategy by starting with a higher \\(\\epsilon\\) to emphasize exploration early on and decaying it going forward to focus more on exploitation. Note that there are plenty of ways to decay \\(\\epsilon\\), from simple linear decaying to more sophisticated approaches.\n\n\nCode\nclass EpsilonGreedyLinDecay(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS, decay_ratio=0.3, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01):\n        super(EpsilonGreedyLinDecay, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n        self.decay_ratio = decay_ratio\n        self.start_eps = start_eps\n        self.min_eps = min_eps\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"EpsilonGreedyLinDecay, decay_ratio={self.decay_ratio}, start_eps={self.start_eps}, min_eps={self.min_eps}\"\n\n    def step(self, t):\n        epsilon = (1 - t / (self.decay_ratio * self.n_steps)) * (self.start_eps - self.min_eps) + self.min_eps\n        epsilon = np.clip(epsilon, self.min_eps, self.start_eps)\n        if rng.random() &lt; epsilon:\n            return rng.integers(0, self.bandit.k)\n        else:\n            return np.argmax(self.Q)\n\n    def run(self):\n        for t in range(self.n_steps):\n            action = self.step(t)\n            reward = self.bandit.gen_reward(action)\n            self.update(action, reward, t)\n\n\nThe decay introduces more hyperparameters that we need to tune for our problem. With the default setting defined by the epsilon-greedy strategy with linear decay, we settle on the second-best arm:\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(EpsilonGreedyLinDecay(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclass EpsilonGreedyExpDecay(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=1000, decay_ratio=0.3, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01):\n        super(EpsilonGreedyExpDecay, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n        self.decay_ratio = decay_ratio\n        self.start_eps = start_eps\n        self.min_eps = min_eps\n\n        epsilons = (0.01 / np.logspace(-2, 0, int(self.n_steps * self.decay_ratio)))\n        epsilons = epsilons * (self.start_eps - self.min_eps) + self.min_eps\n        self.epsilons = np.pad(epsilons, (0, int((1 - self.decay_ratio) * self.n_steps)), 'edge')\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"EpsilonGreedyExpDecay, decay_ratio={self.decay_ratio}, start_eps={self.start_eps}, min_eps={self.min_eps}\"\n\n    def step(self, t):\n        if rng.random() &lt; self.epsilons[t]:\n            return rng.integers(0, self.bandit.k)\n        else:\n            return np.argmax(self.Q)\n\n    def run(self):\n        for t in range(self.n_steps):\n            action = self.step(t)\n            reward = self.bandit.gen_reward(action)\n            self.update(action, reward, t)\n\n\nThe same strategy with exponential decay finds the best arm, however.\nNaturally, chance plays a role here. To see which exploration strategy really works best we would need to rerun our experiment with many different seeds.\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(EpsilonGreedyExpDecay(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftmax Strategy\nDepending on the problem, it can be a disadvantage of the \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy strategy that it selects all actions with equal probability when exploring. The softmax strategy remedies this by making the probability of taking an action proportional to its current Q-value estimate. Put simply, actions with high value estimates are selected more frequently than actions with low estimates. This strategy is also called Boltzmann exploration since the agent draws actions from a Boltzmann (softmax) distribution over the action-value estimates. Note that the agent’s preference for actions with high estimates can be controlled by the temperature parameter \\(\\tau\\): the agent selects the action with the highest value estimate as \\(\\tau\\) approaches \\(0\\), and samples an action uniformly as \\(\\tau\\) approaches infinity.\n\\[\\pi(a) = \\dfrac{\\exp \\left( \\dfrac{Q(a)}{\\tau} \\right)}{\\sum_{b=0}^{n} \\exp \\left( \\dfrac{Q(b)}{\\tau} \\right)}\\]\n\n\nCode\nclass Softmax(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS, decay_ratio=0.05, start_temp=1000, min_temp=1e-10):\n        super(Softmax, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n        self.decay_ratio = decay_ratio\n        self.start_temp = start_temp\n        self.min_temp = min_temp\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"Softmax, decay_ratio={self.decay_ratio}, start_temp={self.start_temp}, min_temp={self.min_temp}\"\n\n    def step(self, t):\n        temp = (1 - t / (self.n_steps * self.decay_ratio)) * (self.start_temp - self.min_temp) + self.min_temp\n        temp = np.clip(temp, self.min_temp, self.start_temp)\n        Q_scaled = self.Q / temp\n        Q_exp = np.exp(Q_scaled - np.max(Q_scaled))\n        probs = Q_exp / np.sum(Q_exp)\n        return rng.choice(np.arange(len(probs)), size=1, p=probs).item()\n\n    def run(self):\n        for t in range(self.n_steps):\n            action = self.step(t)\n            reward = self.bandit.gen_reward(action)\n            self.update(action, reward, t)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(Softmax(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimistic Initialization\nUntil now, we simply used \\(0\\) as the default value for actions that are still unexplored, thereby injecting an initial bias into our method. We can use this bias as a simple way to improve the greedy approach by setting optimistic initial values. What does that mean? If we set the initial estimate to a high value, the agent will be “disappointed” by the rewards early on which encourages exploration until the estimates improve and start converging to the true values. You can see below that this can work quite well in the bandit example. Optimistic initial values have several drawbacks, though. They assume that we have some knowledge about what a “high” value in the environment is (if we set it too high, the algorithm needs many time steps to get more realistic estimates; if we set it too low, the strategy isn’t optimistic and doesn’t work as intended) and they don’t work in nonstationary environments since they only encourage exploration in the beginning.\n\n\nCode\nclass OptimisticInitialization(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS, init_val=1.):\n        super(OptimisticInitialization, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n        self.init_val = init_val\n        self.Q = np.full(self.bandit.k, self.init_val)\n        self.n = np.ones(self.bandit.k, dtype=\"int\")\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"OptimisticInitialization, init_val={self.init_val}\"\n\n    def step(self):\n        return np.argmax(self.Q)\n\n    def reset(self):\n        self.Q = np.full(self.bandit.k, self.init_val)\n        self.n = np.ones(self.bandit.k, dtype=\"int\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(OptimisticInitialization(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpper-Confidence-Bound (UCB) Action Selection\nAnother approach that follows the principle of “optimism in the face of uncertainty” is the UCB strategy which accounts for both the estimated action-value and the uncertainty of the estimate by greedily selecting the action that maximizes the upper confidence bound. To implement this method, we add an uncertainty bonus \\(U(a)\\) to the Q-value estimates and always select the action with the highest total value. The idea is that the true action-value is below that upper confidence bound with high probability. Put simply, we select the action with the highest potential to be optimal. Let’s look at the math:\n\\[A_t = \\text{argmax}_a \\left[ Q_t(a) + U_t{a}\\right] = \\text{argmax}_a \\left[ Q_t(a) + c \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\ln{t}}{N_t(a)}}\\right],\\]\nwhere \\(\\ln t\\) denotes the natural logarithm of \\(t\\), \\(N_t(a)\\) denotes the number of times the agent selected action \\(a\\) prior to time step \\(t\\), and \\(c\\) is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the bonus (and hence the agent’s preference for exploration). As a result, an action that has been selected only a few times after a number of trials has higher associated uncertainty (and higher need for exploration) than an action that was sampled often. As the agent gets more experience and thus more confident in his estimates, the effect of the uncertainty term fades.\n\n\nCode\nclass UCB(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS, c=0.2):\n        super(UCB, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n        self.c = c\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"UCB, c={self.c}\"\n\n    def step(self, t):\n        if t &lt; self.bandit.k:\n            return t\n        else:\n            return np.argmax(self.Q + self.c * np.sqrt(np.log(t) / self.n))\n\n    def run(self):\n        for t in range(self.n_steps):\n            action = self.step(t)\n            reward = self.bandit.gen_reward(action)\n            self.update(action, reward, t)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(UCB(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThompson Sampling\nWhile the UCB strategy is deterministic, Thompson sampling is a sample-based approach for selecting actions that essentially comes down to Bayesian inference. For the Bernoulli bandit, we assume that each Q-value estimate \\(Q(a)\\) follows a Beta distribution, \\(\\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)\\), which is parameterized by two positive parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) that correspond to the number of times we got the reward versus the number of times we didn’t when we took the action. Initially, we set the parameters based on our beliefs for every action, e.g. \\(\\alpha=1\\) and \\(\\beta=1\\) when we believe (without confidence) that the reward probability is \\(0.5\\). Then, at each time step \\(t\\), we sample an expected reward for every action from the respective prior distribution \\(\\text{Beta}(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i)\\) and simply select the best available action. After we have observed the true reward, we update the action’s Beta distribution accordingly.\n\n\nCode\nclass ThompsonSampling(Strategy):\n    def __init__(self, bandit, n_steps=N_STEPS, alpha=1, beta=1):\n        super(ThompsonSampling, self).__init__(bandit, n_steps)\n        self.alpha = alpha\n        self.beta = beta\n        self.alphas = np.full(self.bandit.k, self.alpha)\n        self.betas = np.full(self.bandit.k, self.beta)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"ThompsonSampling, alpha={self.alpha}, beta={self.beta}\"\n\n    def step(self):\n        return np.argmax(rng.beta(self.alphas, self.betas))\n\n    def run(self):\n        for t in range(self.n_steps):\n            action = self.step()\n            reward = self.bandit.gen_reward(action)\n            self.alphas[action] += reward\n            self.betas[action] += (1 - reward)\n            self.update(action, reward, t)\n\n    def reset(self):\n        self.alphas = np.full(self.bandit.k, self.alpha)\n        self.betas = np.full(self.bandit.k, self.beta)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_actions(ThompsonSampling(bandit))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quick comparison\nFinally, we can do a quick comparison using data from 20 runs:\n\n\nCode\ndef experiment(k=10, n_steps=1000, runs=20):\n    regrets = defaultdict(list)\n\n    for run in range(runs):\n        bandit = Bandit(k)\n        \n        for strategy in [GreedyExploitation(bandit, n_steps=n_steps),\n                         RandomExploration(bandit, n_steps=n_steps),\n                         # EpsilonGreedy(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, epsilon=0.01),\n                         EpsilonGreedy(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, epsilon=0.025),\n                         # EpsilonGreedy(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, epsilon=0.04),\n                         EpsilonGreedyLinDecay(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.3, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01),\n                         # EpsilonGreedyLinDecay(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.25, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01),\n                         # EpsilonGreedyLinDecay(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.2, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01),\n                         # EpsilonGreedyExpDecay(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.3, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01),\n                         EpsilonGreedyExpDecay(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.25, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01),\n                         # EpsilonGreedyExpDecay(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.2, start_eps=1.0, min_eps=0.01),\n                         # Softmax(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.075, start_temp=1000, min_temp=1e-10),\n                         Softmax(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.05, start_temp=1000, min_temp=1e-10),\n                         # Softmax(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, decay_ratio=0.03, start_temp=1000, min_temp=1e-10),\n                         # UCB(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, c=0.3),\n                         # UCB(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, c=0.2),\n                         UCB(bandit, n_steps=n_steps, c=0.1),\n                         ThompsonSampling(bandit, n_steps=n_steps)]:\n        \n            strategy.run()\n            regrets[str(strategy)].append(strategy.regrets)\n\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))\n    for strategy, result in regrets.items():\n        ax.plot(np.arange(n_steps), np.cumsum(np.mean(result, axis=0)), label=strategy)\n    \n    ax.legend()\n\n\n\n\nCode\nexperiment()\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next post, we’ll look at the bigger picture again and see how we can solve the RL problem with dynamic programming."

    "text": "Like Monte Carlo (MC) methods, temporal difference (TD) learning methods learn from experience without needing a model of the environment’s dynamics. However, unlike MC methods, TD learning methods can learn from incomplete sequences and thus can be used in continuing environments. Let’s look at this in more detail.\nAs we have discussed in the last post, MC methods can only update their value estimates at the end of an episode since they rely on actual returns \\(G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\dots + \\gamma^{T-1} R_T\\) which can only be computed from complete trajectories. These actual returns \\(G_t\\) are unbiased estimates of the true value function \\(v_{\\pi}(s)\\), but they are also of high variance because they accumulate the inherent randomness of all transitions in an entire episode (recall that all actions, next states, and rewards are random events). This is why MC methods can be slow and sample inefficient (i.e. we need lots of data to see the signal in the noise). TD learning methods, in contrast, leverage the recursive relationship \\(V(S_t) = R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1})\\) to estimate the return and conduct updates online. That is, TD learning methods bootstrap: in their updates they rely in part on existing estimates instead of exclusively requiring actual rewards. It follows that the TD target has low variance (it only accumulates the randomness of a single transition) at the cost of some bias. We’ll see below how this plays out.\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib as plt\nfrom itertools import count\nimport gym\nimport gym_walk"

    "section": "TD Prediction",
    "text": "TD Prediction\nNaturally, we’ll begin by considering the problem of estimating the value function \\(v_{\\pi}\\) for a given policy \\(\\pi\\). As was mentioned above, the key characteristic of TD methods is that they estimate \\(v_{\\pi}\\) using an estimate of \\(v_{\\pi}\\). But how? With one-step TD, n-step TD, and TD(\\(\\lambda\\)) we’ll introduce different methods for TD prediction.\n\nTD(0)\nTD(0) is the simplest TD learning algorithm. It is also called one-step TD since it updates after a single step \\(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1} \\sim \\pi\\) in the environment, that is, immediately after observing the next state \\(S_{t+1}\\) and receiving the reward \\(R_{t+1}\\). Essentially, the algorithm fully exploits the Markov property. Its update looks like this:\n\\[V(S_t) \\leftarrow V(S_t) + \\alpha \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t) \\right],\\]\nwhere \\(R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1})\\) is the TD target and \\(R_{t+1} + \\gamma V(S_{t+1}) - V(S_t)\\) is the TD error. What happens here? Well, TD(0) estimates the return at each step by summing the actual reward \\(R_{t+1}\\) and the discounted estimate of the value of the next state \\(\\gamma V(S_{t+1})\\). The rest of the update should be clear. We compute the TD error and take a small step (defined by the step-size parameter \\(\\alpha\\)) in its direction. If \\(\\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\alpha_t = \\infty\\) and \\(\\sum_{t=1}^{\\infty} \\alpha_t^2 &lt; \\infty\\), TD(0) is guaranteed to converge to \\(v_{\\pi}\\).\n\n\nCode\ndef decay(decay_ratio, start_val, min_val, max_steps, log_start=-2, log_base=10):\n    decay_steps = int(max_steps * decay_ratio)\n    values = np.logspace(log_start, 0, decay_steps, base=log_base, endpoint=True)[::-1]\n    values = (values - values.min()) / (values.max() - values.min())\n    values = (start_val - min_val) * values + min_val\n    values = np.pad(values, (0, max_steps - decay_steps), 'edge')\n    return values\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef td(env, pi, gamma=1., n_episodes=500, start_alpha=0.5, min_alpha=0.01, alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    n_states = env.observation_space.n\n    value = np.zeros(n_states)\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        \n        while not done:\n            action = pi[state]\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            \n            value_next = value[next_state] if not done else 0.\n            value[state] += alphas[ep] * ((reward + gamma * value_next) - value[state])\n            #td_target = reward + gamma * value[next_state] * (not done)\n            #td_error = td_target - value[state]\n            #value[state] = value[state] + alphas[ep] * td_error\n            \n            state = next_state\n    \n    return value\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"RandomWalkFive-v0\")\npi = {state : 0 for state in range(env.prob.shape[0])}\ntd_val = td(env, pi)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(values=td_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"FrozenLake4x4-v2\")\npi = [1 for _ in range(16)]\ntd_val = td(env, pi)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(values=td_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(n\\)-step TD Learning\nWith MC and TD(0) we now have introduced two rather extreme approaches, each having its own advantages. While MC methods update each state based on the entire sequence of actual rewards received from that state until the end of the episode, TD(0) updates are merely based on the next reward, using the current estimate of the next state’s value as a proxy for the remaining rewards. You are not mistaken if you reckon that there must exist a range of algorithms in between those extremes. Indeed, we could perform a two-step update based on the first two rewards and the estimated value of the subsequent state. Similary, we could perform three-step updates, four-step updates, and so on. \\(n\\)-step TD learning is a generalization of this idea. With an intermediate value for \\(n\\) it often performs better than either TD(0) and MC.\nSuppose we want to update the estimated value of state \\(S_t\\) based on the state-reward sequence \\(S_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, R_{t+2}, S_{t+2}, \\dots, R_T, S_T\\). In TD(0), the target would be the one-step return \\(G_{t:t+1}\\):\n\\[G_{t:t+1} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma V_t(S_{t+1}),\\]\nwhere \\(V_t\\) is the estimate of \\(v_{\\pi}\\) at time \\(t\\) and the subscripts on \\(G_{t:t+1}\\) indicate that, to estimate the return at time \\(t\\), we use actual rewards up until time \\(t{+}1\\) and the discounted estimate \\(\\gamma V_t(S_{t+1})\\) to correct for the absence of the other terms \\(\\gamma R_{t+1} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots + \\gamma^{T-t-1}R_T\\).\nA two-step update would simply use the two-step return as a target:\n\\[G_{t:t+2} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 V_{t+1}(S_{t+2}),\\]\nwhere we use \\(\\gamma^2 V_{t+1}(S_{t+2})\\) as a proxy for the terms \\(\\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\gamma^3 R_{t+4} + \\dots + \\gamma^{T-t-1} R_T\\).\nAccordingly, we can perform an n-step update using the \\(n\\)-step return as our target:\n\\[G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\dots + \\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \\gamma^n V_{t+n-1}(S_{t+n}),\\]\nfor all \\(n, t\\) such that \\(n \\geq 1\\) and \\(0 \\leq t &lt; T - n\\). If \\(t+n \\geq T\\), the \\(n\\)-step return would be equal to the complete return, meaning that we would effectively perform an MC update.\nThe update of the n-step TD algorithm looks like this:\n\\[V_{t+n}(S_t) \\leftarrow V_{t+n-1}(S_t) + \\alpha \\left[ G_{t:t+n} - V_{t+n-1}(S_t) \\right]\\]\nNote that no update can occur until \\(R_{t+n}\\) is known, i.e. the updates set in at time step \\(t+n\\) and multiple updates are conducted when the episode has terminated (the updates are catching up in a sense).\n\n\nCode\ndef n_step_td(env, \n              pi, \n              n_step=3, \n              gamma=1., \n              n_episodes=500, \n              start_alpha=0.5, \n              min_alpha=0.01, \n              alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    n_states = env.observation_space.n\n    value = np.zeros(n_states)\n    discounts = np.power(gamma, np.arange(n_step+1))\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        trajectory = []\n        \n        while not done or trajectory is not None:\n            trajectory = trajectory[1:]\n        \n            while not done and len(trajectory) &lt; n_step:\n                action = pi[state]\n                next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n                trajectory.append((state, reward, next_state, done))\n                state = next_state\n                if done:\n                    break\n        \n            n = len(trajectory)\n            state_ = trajectory[0][0]\n            G = discounts[:n] * np.array(trajectory)[:, 1]\n            value_next = value[next_state] if not done else 0.\n            ntd_target = np.sum(np.append(G, discounts[-1] * value_next))\n            value[state_] += alphas[ep] * (ntd_target - value[state_])\n            \n            if trajectory[0][3] and len(trajectory) == 1:\n                trajectory = None\n    \n    return value\n\n\n\n\nCode\nntd_val = n_step_td(env, pi, n_step=3)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(values=ntd_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTD(\\(\\lambda\\))\nInevitably, the question arises which \\(n\\) we should choose to obtain the best results. But instead of choosing a particular \\(n\\), we can take the concept of TD learning one step further by combining multiple \\(n\\)-steps into a single update. One particular way of doing this is the \\(\\lambda\\)-return which is discussed below. We’ll first put it to use in the forward-view TD(\\(\\lambda\\)) algorithm which updates the state-value estimates with a weighted combination of all \\(n\\)-step targets at the end of an episode. Then, we’ll introduce eligibility traces and the more elegant backward-view TD(\\(\\lambda\\)) algorithm which can perform partial updates at each step.\n\nThe \\(\\lambda\\)-return\nIn the last section we introduced the \\(n\\)-step return, defined as the sum of the first \\(n\\) rewards plus the estimated value of the state reached in \\(n\\) steps (each properly discounted):\n\\[G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\dots + \\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \\gamma^n V_{t+n-1}(S_{t+n})\\]\nTo improve on this we can use the average of \\(n\\)-step returns for different \\(n\\) instead of choosing a specific \\(n\\). The \\(\\lambda\\)-return, in particular, averages all the \\(n\\)-step updates, each weighted proportionally to \\(\\lambda^{n-1}\\) (where \\(\\lambda \\in [0,1])\\) and normalized by a factor of \\(1-\\lambda\\) so that the weights sum to \\(1\\). The resulting formula for the \\(\\lambda\\)-return looks like this:\n\\[G_t^{\\lambda} = (1-\\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{T-t-1} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t:t+n} + \\lambda^{T-t-1} G_{t:T} = (1 - \\lambda) \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^{n-1} G_{t:t+n}\\]\nThe one-step return receives the largest weight, \\(1-\\lambda\\), the two-step return receives the next largest weight, \\((1-\\lambda)\\lambda\\), and so on. This goes on for all \\(n\\)-steps until a terminal state is reached. Then the \\(n\\)-step return is equal to the ordinary return \\(G_t\\) and weighted by \\(\\lambda^{T-t-1}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n    G_{t:t+1} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma V_t(S_{t+1}) & \\qquad \\text{is weighted by}\\;\\; (1 - \\lambda) \\\\\n    G_{t:t+2} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 V_{t+1}(S_{t+2}) & \\qquad \\text{is weighted by}\\;\\; (1 - \\lambda)\\lambda \\\\\n    G_{t:t+3} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\gamma^3 V_{t+2}(S_{t+3}) & \\qquad \\text{is weighted by}\\;\\; (1 - \\lambda)\\lambda^2 \\\\\n    G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \\dots + \\gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \\gamma^n V_{t+n-1} (S_{t+n}) & \\qquad \\text{is weighted by}\\;\\; (1 - \\lambda)\\lambda^{n-1} \\\\\n    G_{t:T} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\dots + \\gamma^{T-1} R_T & \\qquad \\text{is weighted by}\\;\\; \\lambda^{T-t-1}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nWhen looking at the formula it should become clear that the \\(\\lambda\\)-return offers a spectrum of methods spanning from one-step TD (\\(\\lambda=0\\)) to MC (\\(\\lambda=1\\)), where methods in between often perform better than both extremes.\n\n\nforward-view TD(\\(\\lambda\\))\nForward-view TD(\\(\\lambda\\)) is the simplest learning algorithm applying the \\(\\lambda\\)-return. Its update looks like this:\n\\[V_T(S_t) = V_{T-1}(S_t) + \\alpha_t \\left[ G_{t:T}^{\\lambda} - V_{T-1}(S_t) \\right],\\]\nwhere \\(G_{t:T}^{\\lambda}\\) is the \\(\\lambda\\)-return and \\(G_{t:T}^{\\lambda} - V_{T-1}(S_t)\\) is the \\(\\lambda\\)-error. Its problem, however, is that the algorithm like MC methods has to wait until the end of an episode before it can make updates to the value function estimates. Fortunately, researchers have developed backward-view TD(\\(\\lambda\\)), a more sophisticated method that can apply partial updates on every time step.\n\n\nEligibility traces and backward-view TD(\\(\\lambda\\))\nBackward-view TD(\\(\\lambda\\)), or simply TD(\\(\\lambda\\)) for short, uses eligibility traces to determine if, and by how much, a state is eligible for an update. An eligibility trace is a memory vector that tracks the recently visited states. Let’s walk through the process to see how the algorithm works.\nIn the beginning, all eligibility traces are initialized to zero:\n\\[E_0(s) = 0, \\quad \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\]\nWhen the agent has interacted with the environment for one cycle \\(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1} \\sim \\pi_{t:t+1}\\), we increment the eligibility of state \\(S_t\\) by \\(1\\)\n\\[E_t(S_t) = E_t(S_t) + 1\\]\nand calculate the TD error\n\\[\\delta_{t} = R_{t+1} + \\gamma V_t(S_{t+1}) - V_t(S_t)\\]\nin order to perform the following update:\n\\[V_{t+1}(s) = V_t(s) + \\alpha_t \\delta_{t}E_t(s), \\quad \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\]\nBy multiplying the update for all states by the eligibility trace \\(E\\) we ensure that each state is updated according to its respective eligibility.\nFinally, we decay the eligibility trace vector by \\(\\lambda\\) (the same \\(\\lambda\\) as introduced with the \\(\\lambda\\)-return, also called the trace-decay parameter) and \\(\\gamma\\) (the discount factor) so that the traces fade away:\n\\[E_{t+1} = \\gamma \\lambda  E_t\\]\nIn essence, TD(\\(\\lambda\\)) has three advantages:\n\nIt is flexible since it spans methods from one-step TD to MC, depending on \\(\\lambda\\).\nIt performs updates at every time step which is more computationally efficient.\nIt makes sure that learning occurs continually and affects the behavior of the agent right away (i.e. immediately after a state is encountered).\n\n\n\nCode\ndef td_lambda(env,\n              pi,\n              gamma=1., \n              lambda_ = 0.3,\n              n_episodes=500, \n              start_alpha=0.5, \n              min_alpha=0.01, \n              alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    n_states = env.observation_space.n\n    value = np.zeros(n_states)\n    E = np.zeros(n_states)\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        E.fill(0)\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        \n        while not done:\n            action = pi[state]\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            value_next = value[next_state] if not done else 0.\n            E[state] += 1\n            value += alphas[ep] * ((reward + gamma * value[next_state]) - value[state]) * E\n            E *= gamma * lambda_\n            state = next_state\n    \n    return value\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntdl_val = td_lambda(env, pi)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(values=tdl_val)"

    "text": "TD Control\nTo extend TD methods to the control problem, we once again draw on the pattern of generalized policy iteration (GPI). Recall that GPI consists of two interacting processes: predicting the value function of the current policy (for which we now use TD prediction) and improving the policy with respect to the current value function (where we have to deal with the exploration-exploitation trade-off). With this in mind, we distinguish two classes of methods. On-policy methods evaluate and improve the policy that is used to make decisions, which means that the agent has to seek the best policy that still accounts for exploration. Off-policy methods, on the other hand, separate both concerns by evaluating and improving a policy (the target policy) that is different from the one used to generate the behavior (the behavior policy). This is a more complex, but also a more powerful idea: since both policies can be unrelated, the behavior policy can keep sampling all possible actions while the agent learns a deterministic optimal policy.\nWe’ll see both concepts in action when we introduce some of the classic RL algorithms below.\n\nSarsa\nSarsa is an algorithm for on-policy TD control, that is, it estimates \\(q_{\\pi}(s,a)\\) for the current behavior policy \\(\\pi\\) and makes \\(\\pi\\) greedy with respect to \\(q_{\\pi}\\) (recall that we need to learn an action-value function instead of a state-value function to know which actions to take). Thus, to apply the TD method, we need to look at the transition from one state-action pair to the next. The corresponding sequence \\(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}\\) gives rise to the algorithm’s name: Sarsa. Its update, performed after every transition from a nonterminal state \\(S_t\\), uses every element of this sequence:\n\\[Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) - Q(S_t, A_t) \\right]\\]\nSarsa converges to an optimal policy if all state-action pairs are visited infinitely often and the policy converges in the limit to the greedy policy (again, this is referred to as being Greedy in the Limit with Infinite Exploration, GLIE).\n\n\nCode\ndef sarsa(env, \n          gamma=1., \n          n_episodes=5000, \n          start_eps=1., \n          min_eps=0.1, \n          eps_decay_ratio=0.9, \n          start_alpha=0.5, \n          min_alpha=0.01, \n          alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    \n    n_states, n_actions = env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    epsilons = decay(eps_decay_ratio, start_eps, min_eps, n_episodes)\n    \n    q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    pi = lambda state, q, epsilon: np.argmax(q[state]) if np.random.random() &gt; epsilon else np.random.randint(len(q[state]))\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        action = pi(state, q, epsilons[ep])\n        \n        while not done:\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            next_action = pi(next_state, q, epsilons[ep])\n            q_next = q[next_state][next_action] if not done else 0.\n            td_target = reward + gamma * q_next\n            q[state][action] += alphas[ep] * (td_target - q[state][action])\n            state, action = next_state, next_action\n        \n    value = np.max(q, axis=1)\n    pi = {state: action for state, action in enumerate(np.argmax(q, axis=1))}\n    return value, pi\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsarsa_val, sarsa_pi = sarsa(env, n_episodes=5000)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(policy=sarsa_pi, values=sarsa_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSarsa(\\(\\lambda\\))\nThe original version of Sarsa, discussed above, is also referred to as one-step Sarsa or Sarsa(0) because it uses the one-step TD target. Correspondingly, Sarsa can be combined with the \\(n\\)-step return to obtain \\(n\\)-step Sarsa, and with the \\(\\lambda\\)-return to obtain Sarsa(\\(\\lambda\\)). Here, we skip \\(n\\)-step Sarsa und turn our attention to the more powerful Sarsa(\\(\\lambda\\)) algorithm right away.\nThe key idea of Sarsa(\\(\\lambda\\)) is to use the TD(\\(\\lambda\\)) prediction method for state-action pairs rather than states. Therefore, we need an eligibility matrix to track each state-action pair instead of an eligibility vector that merely tracks states. Apart from that the method equals TD(\\(\\lambda\\)). We begin by initializing each eligibility trace to zero\n\\[E_0(s,a) = 0, \\quad \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}, a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)\\]\nWhen the agent has interacted with the environment for one sequence \\(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1} \\sim \\pi\\), we increment the eligibility of the state-action pair \\(S_t, A_t\\) by \\(1\\)\n\\[E_t(S_t, A_t) = E_t(S_t, A_t) + 1,\\]\ncalculate the error\n\\[\\delta_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_t(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) - Q_t(S_t, A_t)\\]\nand apply the update for every state \\(s\\) and action \\(a\\):\n\\[Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a) + \\alpha_t \\delta_t E_t(s,a), \\quad \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}, a \\in \\mathcal{A} \\]\nFinally, we decay the eligibility traces:\n\\[E_{t+1}(s,a) = \\gamma \\lambda E_t(s,a), \\quad \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}, a \\in \\mathcal{A}\\]\n\n\nCode\ndef sarsa_lambda(env, \n                 gamma=1., \n                 n_episodes=5000, \n                 lambda_ = 0.5,\n                 replacing_traces=True,\n                 start_eps=1.,\n                 min_eps=0.1, \n                 eps_decay_ratio=0.9, \n                 start_alpha=0.5, \n                 min_alpha=0.01, \n                 alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    \n    n_states, n_actions = env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    epsilons = decay(eps_decay_ratio, start_eps, min_eps, n_episodes)\n    \n    q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    E = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    pi = lambda state, q, epsilon: np.argmax(q[state]) if np.random.random() &gt; epsilon else np.random.randint(len(q[state]))\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        E.fill(0)\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        action = pi(state, q, epsilons[ep])\n        \n        while not done:\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            next_action = pi(next_state, q, epsilons[ep])\n            \n            q_next = q[next_state][next_action] if not done else 0.\n            td_target = reward + gamma * q_next\n            if replacing_traces:\n                E[state].fill(0)\n            E[state][action] += 1\n            if replacing_traces:\n                E.clip(0, 1, out=E)\n            q += alphas[ep] * (td_target - q[state][action]) * E\n            E *= gamma * lambda_\n            \n            state, action = next_state, next_action\n    \n    value = np.max(q, axis=1)\n    pi = {state: action for state, action in enumerate(np.argmax(q, axis=1))}\n    return value, pi\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsarsa_lambda_val, sarsa_lambda_pi = sarsa_lambda(env, n_episodes=5000)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(policy=sarsa_lambda_pi, values=sarsa_lambda_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ-learning\nUnlike Sarsa, Q-learning is an off-policy TD control method. This means that the action-value function \\(Q\\) (the one we learn) approximates the optimal action-value function \\(q_*\\) independent of the policy being followed. For the convergence of the algorithm it is merely required that the behavior policy continues to visit all state-action pairs (this deserves no special attention since any method guaranteeing to find an optimal policy has this requirement).\nLet’s look at the update rule:\n\\[Q(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_a Q(S_{t+1}, a) - Q(S_t, A_t) \\right]\\]\nWe see that the Q-learning algorithm does not use the behavior policy to choose the action \\(A_{t+1}\\) used in its target. Instead it uses the action with maximum best estimated value (it is not relevant which action this is). Hence, the algorithm is able to find an optimal policy even if the agent acts randomly.\n\n\nCode\ndef q_learning(env,\n               gamma=1.,\n               n_episodes=5000,\n               start_eps=1.,\n               min_eps=0.1,\n               eps_decay_ratio=0.9,\n               start_alpha=0.5,\n               min_alpha=0.01,\n               alpha_decay_ratio=0.5):\n    n_states, n_actions = env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    epsilons = decay(eps_decay_ratio, start_eps, min_eps, n_episodes)\n    q = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    draw_action = lambda state, q, epsilon: np.argmax(q[state]) if np.random.random() &gt; epsilon else np.random.randint(len(q[state]))\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        \n        while not done:\n            action = draw_action(state, q, epsilons[ep])\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            q_next = np.max(q[next_state, :]) if not done else 0.\n            td_target = reward + gamma * q_next\n            q[state][action] += alphas[ep] * (td_target - q[state][action])\n            state = next_state\n        \n    value = np.max(q, axis=1)\n    pi = {state: action for state, action in enumerate(np.argmax(q, axis=1))}\n    return value, pi\n\n\n\n\nCode\nq_val, q_pi = q_learning(env, n_episodes=5000)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(policy=q_pi, values=q_val)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble Q-learning\nA problem with the Q-learning algorithm is that it overestimates the action-value function: on every step it uses a maximum over estimated values as an estimate of the true maximum action-value of the next state, resulting in what can be a substantial positive bias. To illustrate this, just imagine a state \\(s\\) where five actions \\(a\\) can be taken whose true values \\(q(s,a)\\) are zero, but whose estimated values \\(Q(s,a)\\) are uncertain and distributed around zero: \\(-0.33, 0.70, 0.05, -0.16, 0.48\\). While the maximum of the true action-values is zero, the maximum of the estimates is always positive (here: \\(0.70\\)). This maximization bias is mitigated by an idea called double learning. In Double Q-learning, we keep two separate estimates of the action-value function, \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_2\\). At each time step, we randomly choose one of them to determine the action (the action with the highest estimated value), and the other one to provide the estimated value of that action.\nIf we choose \\(Q_1\\) to determine the action, the update is\n\\[ Q_1(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q_1(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_{2}\\left(S_{t+1}, \\text{argmax}_a Q_1(S_{t+1}, a) \\right) - Q_1(S_t, A_t) \\right].\\]\nIf we choose \\(Q_2\\) to determine the action, we simply switch \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_2\\) to obtain the following update:\n\\[Q_2(S_t, A_t) \\leftarrow Q_2(S_t, A_t) + \\alpha \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma Q_1\\left(S_{t+1}, \\text{argmax}_a Q_2(S_{t+1}, a) \\right) - Q_2(S_t, A_t) \\right].\\]\nThe behavior policy can use both estimates of the \\(Q\\)-function to interact with the environment (by using the average or the sum, for instance).\n\n\nCode\ndef double_q_learning(env,\n                      gamma=1.,\n                      n_episodes=5000,\n                      start_eps=1.,\n                      min_eps=0.1,\n                      eps_decay_ratio=0.9,\n                      start_alpha=0.5,\n                      min_alpha=0.01,\n                      alpha_decay_ratio=0.5\n                      ):\n    n_states, n_actions = env.observation_space.n, env.action_space.n\n    alphas = decay(alpha_decay_ratio, start_alpha, min_alpha, n_episodes)\n    epsilons = decay(eps_decay_ratio, start_eps, min_eps, n_episodes)\n    q1 = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    q2 = np.zeros((n_states, n_actions))\n    draw_action = lambda state, q, epsilon: np.argmax(q[state]) if np.random.random() &gt; epsilon else np.random.randint(len(q[state]))\n    \n    for ep in range(n_episodes):\n        state = env.reset()\n        done = False\n        \n        while not done:\n            action = draw_action(state, (q1 + q2)/2, epsilons[ep])\n            next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)\n            \n            if np.random.randint(2):\n                td_target = reward + gamma * q2[next_state][np.argmax(q1[next_state])] * (not done)\n                q1[state][action] += alphas[ep] * (td_target - q1[state][action])\n            else:\n                td_target = reward + gamma * q1[next_state][np.argmax(q2[next_state])] * (not done)\n                q2[state][action] += alphas[ep] * (td_target - q2[state][action])\n            state = next_state\n    \n    q = (q1 + q2)/2\n    value = np.max(q, axis=1)\n    pi = {state: action for state, action in enumerate(np.argmax(q, axis=1))}\n    return value, pi\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv = gym.make(\"FrozenLake4x4-v2\")\ndq_val, dq_pi = double_q_learning(env, n_episodes=20000)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nenv.render(policy=dq_pi, values=dq_val)"

Instead they should be treated as uncertainty scores that have to be calibrated. Let’s see how conformal prediction comes to the rescue.\nIn conformal prediction, we first set aside some unseen data for calibration; this is usually called the calibration split (this is not equal to the validation data but an additional split). After training a model on the training data, we compute output “probabilities” for the examples in the calibration data and use them to compute a new score of uncertainty, the non-conformity scores:\nnon_conformity_score = 1 - score_for_true_class\nFor example, if the model predicts a score of \\(0.89\\) for the correct class, the non-conformity score for this example will be \\(1 - 0.89 = 0.11\\). That is, if the model is confident and correct, the corresponding score will be low; if the model is confident and wrong, the score will be high.\n\n\nCode\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.3)\nX_val, X_cal, y_val, y_cal = train_test_split(X_val, y_val, test_size=0.4)\n\nmodel = RandomForestClassifier()\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n\nRandomForestClassifier()In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

For non-conformity scores below q_hat, we know that, with probability \\(1-\\alpha\\), the prediction includes the correct class. That is, for prediction we would compute the non-conformity scores for all examples (that we want to predict), and select all class labels with a score below q_hat. This of course means that we can end up with prediction sets (i.e., predictions that include more than one class):\n\n\nCode\npreds = model.predict_proba(X_test)\npreds\n\n\narray([[0.98, 0.02, 0.  ],\n       [1.  , 0.  , 0.  ],\n       [0.  , 1.  , 0.  ],\n       ...,\n       [0.  , 0.04, 0.96],\n       [1.  , 0.  , 0.  ],\n       [1.  , 0.  , 0.  ]])\n\n\n\n\nCode\npreds_set = 1 - preds &lt;= q_hat\npreds_set\n\n\narray([[ True, False, False],\n       [ True, False, False],\n       [False,  True, False],\n       ...,\n       [False, False,  True],\n       [ True, False, False],\n       [ True, False, False]])\n\n\nOf course there is more to it (e.g., there are more ways to compute the conformity scores), but this is conformal prediction in a nutshell. Luckily, there’s the MAPIE library that is scikit-learn compatible, easy to use, and hides away many complexities. Learn more about the theory behind it here.\nLet’s see how we can use mapie in our example. Essentially, we wrap our model in the MapieClassifier class and fit it on the calibration data.

    "text": "Conformalized Quantile Regression\nInterestingly, there is another option for conformal prediction in regression problems: conformalized quantile regression. That is, we start with a quantile regression model (e.g., a HistGradientBoostingRegressor with loss=\"quantile\" or a LightGBM model with objective=\"quantile\") that already outputs lower and upper quantiles, and use conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees. MAPIE offers a MapieQuantileRegressor class dedicated to this purpose.\nThe computation of the non-conformity score changes again:\nnon_conformity_score = max(q_low - y, y - q_up)\nWe now get positive scores when the true value (y) lies outside of the interval predicted by the quantile regression model, and negative scores if it lies inside. The threshold q_hat can now be interpreted as an adjustment term for the width of the prediction intervals. That is, if the threshold value is positive, the prediction intervals get expanded (by that value) on both ends. If the threshold value is negative, the prediction intervals become more narrow.\nSince quantile regression is inherently adaptive, this will result in adaptive prediction intervals (even though the procedure for calibration is not adaptive).\nLet’s work with the concrete strength dataset again. (Note: Since the focus of this blog post is on conformal prediction, we don’t spend time with feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization.)\n\n\nCode\nmodel = HistGradientBoostingRegressor(loss=\"quantile\", quantile=0.05, learning_rate=0.09)\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\nmapie = MapieQuantileRegressor(estimator=model, alpha=0.05)\nmapie.fit(X_train, y_train, X_calib=X_cal, y_calib=y_cal)\ny_pred, y_pis = mapie.predict(X_test)\n\n\n/Users/jm/mambaforge/envs/scibase/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mapie/utils.py:484: UserWarning: WARNING: The predictions of the quantile regression have issues.\nThe upper quantile predictions are lower\nthan the lower quantile predictions\nat some points.\n  warnings.warn(\n/Users/jm/mambaforge/envs/scibase/lib/python3.10/site-packages/mapie/utils.py:502: UserWarning: WARNING: The predictions have issues.\nThe upper predictions are lower thanthe lower predictions at some points.\n  warnings.warn(\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncoverage_score = regression_coverage_score(y_test, y_pis[:, 0, 0], y_pis[:, 1, 0])\nprint(f\"Coverage score: {coverage_score:.3f}\")\nwidth = regression_mean_width_score(y_pis[:, 0, 0], y_pis[:, 1, 0])\nprint(f\"Interval width: {width:.3f}\")\n\n\nCoverage score: 0.990\nInterval width: 26.275\n\n\nLet’s plot the prediction intervals again. As promised, they are now adaptive:\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 7))\ny_test_sorted, y_pred_sorted, lower_bound, upper_bound = sort_y_values(y_test, y_pred, y_pis)\nplot_prediction_intervals(ax, y_test_sorted, y_pred_sorted, lower_bound, upper_bound)\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s a wrap! Conformal prediction doesn’t stop at simple tabular classification and regression tasks, however. Since the procedure doesn’t require specific models we can use conformal prediction even for tasks like image segmentation. Have a look at this repo for more resources."

The histograms below show the following:\n\nThe pitch is around 160 units wide, 200 units long, and 40 units high.\nAll dimensions are centered, which means that the point [0, 0 ,0] is where the kick-off happens (i.e. where each game begins and resumes after a goal).\nThe most common ball positions for all dimensions are 0. This is not surprising because all events in the dataset begin with a kick-off.\nFor the x dimension, values at the sides of the pitch appear more often.\nFor the y dimension, the histogram shows that the gameplay is somewhat orientated towards the goals. The rather small values at either side probably reflect that the ball was in the respective goal.\nFor the z dimension, we can see that higher values appear increasingly less frequently. Still, the ball is quite often flying in the air.\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(\"Ball positions (min/max):\")\nfor coord in [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]:\n    mi, ma = df[f\"ball_pos_{coord}\"].min(), df[f\"ball_pos_{coord}\"].max()\n    print(f\"{coord} coordinate: min = {mi:.3f}\\t max = {ma:.3f}\")\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 3))\nfor ax, f in zip(axs.ravel(), [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    ax.hist(df[f\"ball_pos_{f}\"], bins=100)\n    ax.set_xlabel(f, fontsize=12)\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\nBall positions (min/max):\nx coordinate: min = -80.600  max = 80.663\ny coordinate: min = -104.309     max = 104.308\nz coordinate: min = 1.142    max = 39.428\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of the pitch and position of the goals\nLet’s focus on observations where the ball is inside the goal.\nWe can see that:\n\nthe goals are centered at x=0 on either side of the pitch\nthe goal lines are at y=-100 and y=100, respectively\nthe goals are around 35 units wide and 12 units high\nif a goal is scored:\n\nthe x position of the ball when crossing the goal line is essentially uniformly distributed\nthe ball sometimes just barely crosses the goal line (see the two small bars of the histogram for the y dimension)\nmost goals are scored with the ball rolling on the pitch (or flying very low), otherwise the z dimension is quite uniformly distributed\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntmp = df.loc[df.ball_pos_y.abs() &gt; 102]\n\nfor coord in [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]:\n    abs_ = tmp[f\"ball_pos_{coord}\"].abs()\n    mi, ma = abs_.min(), abs_.max()\n    print(f\"{coord} coordinate: min = {mi:.3f}\\t max = {ma:.3f}\")\n    \nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 3))\nfor ax, f in zip(axs.ravel(), [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    ax.hist(tmp[f\"ball_pos_{f}\"], bins=100)\n    ax.set_xlabel(f, fontsize=12)\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\nx coordinate: min = 0.001    max = 16.379\ny coordinate: min = 102.001  max = 104.309\nz coordinate: min = 1.606    max = 11.085\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also simply plot all ball positions in the dataset. Apart from seeing the goals, this allows us to notice the indented shape of the corners of the pitch:\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3, 4.5))\nsubset = df.sample(n=int(1e6), random_state=1)\nax.scatter(subset.ball_pos_x, subset.ball_pos_y, s=0.1, alpha=0.01, color=\"black\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBall position and goal scoring\nIt seems natural that the position of the ball is related to our target. Let’s plot the ball positions (the x and y dimension for now) depending on the outcome. There are a few things to notice:\n\nIf either team scores in the next ten seconds, the ball unsurprisingly tends to be in the half of the defending team, particularly in front of the goal.\nIt seems to be common that a goal is scored in the 10 seconds after kick-off (since we can clearly see the center spot in the scatterplots).\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(12, 6))\nteam_A_scores = df[df.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\nteam_B_scores = df[df.team_B_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\nno_goal = df[(df.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 0) & (df.team_B_scoring_within_10sec == 0)]\nno_goal = no_goal.sample(n=int(1e6), random_state=1)\naxs[0].scatter(team_A_scores.ball_pos_x, team_A_scores.ball_pos_y, s=0.1, alpha=0.05, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\naxs[0].set_title(\"When team A scores in the next 10 secs\")\naxs[1].scatter(team_B_scores.ball_pos_x, team_B_scores.ball_pos_y, s=0.1, alpha=0.05, color=\"#a60717\")\naxs[1].set_title(\"When team B scores in the next 10 secs\")\naxs[2].scatter(no_goal.ball_pos_x, no_goal.ball_pos_y, s=0.01, alpha=0.05, color=\"#818182\")\naxs[2].set_title(\"When no team scores in the next 10 secs\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it might be interesting to what changes when we alter the time until the goal is scored. Let’s plot the same scatterplots for the intervals [7, 6], [5, 4], [3, 2], [2, 1], and [1, 0.1].\nWhat can we learn from the plots?\nWhile there are no obvious patterns in earlier time steps (when the gameplay appears to be quite spread out all over the pitch), the game usually begins to shift to the half of the defending team at around 5 seconds before a goal. Then it gets further condensed as time progresses. 2 to 1 seconds before a goal, the gameplay is typically thoroughly concentrated in the half of the defending team, particularly in its center as well as directly in front of the goal. This continues until the very last time steps when the ball generally is directly in front of or already partly in the goal.\nWhen we focus on the center spot, we can see that some goals are scored only 7 to 5 seconds after kick-off. This holds true (though to a lesser extent) for the [5, 4] and even the [3, 2] interval. Afterwards the center spot vanishes in the scatterplots, meaning that goals in less than 2 seconds after kick-off are very rare.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 5, figsize=(16, 4), sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[col].scatter(tmp.ball_pos_x, tmp.ball_pos_y, s=0.1, alpha=.5, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[col].set_title(f\"Goal scored in the next {abs(interval[0])} to {abs(interval[1])} secs\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the z dimension? Let’s plot y against z. What is somewhat surprising is that some goals appear to be scored from a nearly vertical angle.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 5, figsize=(16, 4), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[col].scatter(tmp.ball_pos_y, tmp.ball_pos_z, s=0.1, alpha=.5, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[col].set_title(f\"Goal scored in the next {abs(interval[0])} to {abs(interval[1])} secs\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let’s plot x against z:\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 5, figsize=(16, 4), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[col].scatter(tmp.ball_pos_x, tmp.ball_pos_z, s=0.1, alpha=.5, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[col].set_title(f\"Goal scored in the next {abs(interval[0])} to {abs(interval[1])} secs\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBall velocity\nThe velocity of the ball is provided as a 3d vector by the ball_vel_[xyz] features. The histograms for each dimension don’t contain any big surprises (the maxima at 0 are due to the kick-off), only the two local maxima of the y dimension are striking.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 3))\nfor ax, f in zip(axs.ravel(), [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    ax.hist(df[f\"ball_vel_{f}\"], bins=100, color=\"#400170\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(f, fontsize=12)\nfig.tight_layout()\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 5))\ntmp = df.sample(n=int(1e6), random_state=1)\naxs[0].scatter(tmp.ball_vel_x, tmp.ball_vel_y, s=0.1, alpha=0.01, color=\"#400170\")\naxs[0].set_xlabel(\"x\")\naxs[0].set_ylabel(\"y\")\naxs[1].scatter(tmp.ball_vel_x, tmp.ball_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.01, color=\"#400170\")\naxs[1].set_xlabel(\"x\")\naxs[1].set_ylabel(\"z\")\naxs[2].scatter(tmp.ball_vel_y, tmp.ball_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.01, color=\"#400170\")\naxs[2].set_xlabel(\"y\")\naxs[2].set_ylabel(\"z\")\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBall velocity and goal scoring\nIs there a relationship between the velocity of the ball and the scoring of a goal? Let’s see. We’ll plot scatterplots of all three dimensions of the velocity vector for different time intervals (the y axis of the plot shows the interval mean) before a goal.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(16, 4), sharex=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, c in enumerate([\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    axs[col].set_xlabel(f\"{c} velocity\")\n    axs[col].axvline(0, color=\"black\", lw=0.5)\n    for interval in intervals:\n        tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n        tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n        m = abs(interval[0] + interval[1])/2\n        axs[col].scatter(tmp[f\"ball_vel_{c}\"], np.repeat(m, tmp.shape[0]), s=7.5, alpha=.005, color=\"#400170\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe x values are centered with no extreme values in either direction (this is not surprising given the position of the goal).\nThe y values are increasingly shifted to positive values. Since we are looking at team A (which attacks in the direction of positive y values), this not surprising, too. With only a few seconds left before the goal, there are a quite lot samples with negative y velocities, though.\nThe z values narrow the closer we get to the goal and get somewhat shifted in the negative direction. Given that goals can be scored from flying cars, this is to be expected, but still interesting.\n\nFinally we can plot the dimensions against each other.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 3, figsize=(8, 10), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor row, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[row][0].scatter(tmp.ball_vel_x, tmp.ball_vel_y, s=0.1, alpha=0.05, color=\"#400170\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][0].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n    axs[row][0].set_ylabel(\"y\")\n    axs[row][1].scatter(tmp.ball_vel_x, tmp.ball_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.05, color=\"#400170\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][1].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n    axs[row][1].set_ylabel(\"z\")\n    axs[row][2].scatter(tmp.ball_vel_y, tmp.ball_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.05, color=\"#400170\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][2].set_xlabel(\"y\")\n    axs[row][2].set_ylabel(\"z\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer position\nThe position of player i is provided with x, y, and z coordinates in the p{i}_pos_[xyz] features. Since the histograms of members of the same team are identical, only histograms for player 0 (first player of team A) and 3 (first player of team B) are shown. As expected, they are essentially mirror images. The histograms show the following:\n\nFor the x dimension, values at the center and the extremes are the most common. The latter is probably due to the fact that cars can drive up the walls to gain height.\nFor the y dimension, we can see that players are more often in their own half of the pitch than in the half of their opponents (team A attacks in the direction of positive y values). There are peaks on both goal lines, in front of the goals, and in the center of the pitch.\nFor the z dimension, we can see that high values appear quite rarely (in stark contrast to the ball). As mentioned earlier, the cars require “boost” (which is not abundantly available) to fly in the z dimension.\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(\"Player positions (min/max):\")\nfor coord in [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]:\n    mi, ma = df[f\"p0_pos_{coord}\"].min(), df[f\"p0_pos_{coord}\"].max()\n    print(f\"{coord} coordinate: min = {mi:.3f}\\t max = {ma:.3f}\")\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 3))\nfor ax, f in zip(axs.ravel(), [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    ax.hist(df[f\"p{0}_pos_{f}\"], bins=100)\n    ax.set_xlabel(f, fontsize=12)\nfig.suptitle(\"Player 0 (team A)\")\nfig.tight_layout()\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 3))\nfor ax, f in zip(axs.ravel(), [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    ax.hist(df[f\"p{3}_pos_{f}\"], bins=100)\n    ax.set_xlabel(f, fontsize=12)\nfig.suptitle(\"Player 3 (team B)\")\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\nPlayer positions (min/max):\nx coordinate: min = -81.904  max = 81.931\ny coordinate: min = -119.820     max = 119.766\nz coordinate: min = 0.026    max = 40.862\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, we can also plot all available player positions in the dataset on a map. The “big boost orbs” (more on them soon) are highlighted by black circles (only in the first column for better visibility).\n\n\nCode\ndef draw_boost_orbs(ax):\n    for x, y in [(-61.4, -81.9), (61.4, -81.9), (-71.7, 0), (71.7, 0), (-61.4, 81.9), (61.4, 81.9)]:\n        ax.add_patch(patches.Circle((x, y), 10, color=\"black\", fill=False))\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(10, 8), sharex=True, sharey=True)\ntmp = df.sample(n=int(1e6), random_state=1)\nfor col, p in enumerate(range(3)):\n    axs[0][col].scatter(tmp[f\"p{p}_pos_x\"], tmp[f\"p{p}_pos_y\"], s=0.1, alpha=0.015, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[0][col].set_title(f\"Player {p}\")\n    if col == 0: draw_boost_orbs(axs[0][col])\n    axs[1][col].scatter(tmp[f\"p{p+3}_pos_x\"], tmp[f\"p{p+3}_pos_y\"], s=0.1, alpha=0.015, color=\"#a60717\")\n    axs[1][col].set_title(f\"Player {p+3}\")\n    if col == 0: draw_boost_orbs(axs[1][col])\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots show many apparent visual structures. Maybe these can be explained by the starting positions of the players, the boost positions (the big boost orbs at both sides certainly attract players), and preferred routes to drive up walls. We can also see that the most common defending positions are in an arc in front of the goal, sometimes defending players even drive partly inside their own goal. Generally there appear to be no differences between players and teams.\n\nPlayer position and goal scoring\nLet’s see whether the visual structures disappear when we sort the data by the amount of time until a goal is scored. Since players of the same team don’t show any differences, we’ll only look at players 0 (when attacking) and 3 (when defending), respectively.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(16, 8), sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[0][col].scatter(tmp.p0_pos_x, tmp.p0_pos_y, s=0.2, alpha=.5, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[0][col].set_title(f\"Goal scored in the next {abs(interval[0])} to {abs(interval[1])} secs\")\n    axs[1][col].scatter(tmp.p3_pos_x, tmp.p3_pos_y, s=0.2, alpha=.5, color=\"#a60717\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it gets interesting. Some structures that we’ve just seen have now disappeared, but not all of them. We can clearly see that in the first and second interval (7 to 4 seconds before the goal) players of the attacking team are not necessarily in the half of their opponents (in fact, they are in their own half more often than not). This changes afterwards: the bulk of recorded positions of attacking players consistently moves towards the side of the team that will soon concede the goal and becomes increasingly centered. Meanwhile defending players increasingly move centrally towards their own goal and are usually positioned directly in front of their goal just before the goal is scored. The distance of the players (and teams) to the ball and the goal(s) will likely be very useful predictors.\nLet’s move on to plotting the x versus the z dimension (we’ll skip the first interval). We only look events that end with a goal for team A.\nIf the players use their boost to fly, they position themselves more centrally in front of the goal the closer in time we get to the scored goal. Attacking players use more of the height and width of the pitch than defending players.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 4, figsize=(16, 8), sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[0][col].scatter(tmp.p0_pos_x, tmp.p0_pos_z, s=0.2, alpha=.5, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[0][col].set_title(f\"Goal scored in the next {abs(interval[0])} to {abs(interval[1])} secs\")\n    axs[1][col].scatter(tmp.p3_pos_x, tmp.p3_pos_z, s=0.2, alpha=.5, color=\"#a60717\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat about the y versus the z dimension (we’ll again skip the first interval)?\nThe players of both teams move consistently towards the goal (whether they fly or not) the closer in time we get to the goal with the defending players trying to block the attackers directly in front of the goal.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 4, figsize=(16, 8), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[0][col].scatter(tmp.p0_pos_y, tmp.p0_pos_z, s=0.1, alpha=.5, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[0][col].set_title(f\"Goal scored in the next {abs(interval[0])} to {abs(interval[1])} secs\")\n    axs[1][col].scatter(tmp.p3_pos_y, tmp.p3_pos_z, s=0.1, alpha=.5, color=\"#a60717\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing values (demolished players)\nWhat we haven’t looked at until now is the issue of demolished players. If a player gets demolished in a collision, he will miss on the pitch until he gets respawned.\nAs we can see, if team A misses player(s) it is much less likely to score a goal. Thus, missing values have high predictive value. In practice, we’d probably want to dive deeper (are there any patterns relating to other variables? can we predict demolitions?); here we’ll move on for the sake of brevity.\n\n\nCode\ndf[\"team_A_active\"] = df[[f\"p{i}_pos_x\" for i in range(3)]].notna().sum(axis=1)\n\nfor n in range(1, 4):\n    tmp = df[df.team_A_active == n]\n    print(\"Active players team A:\", n)\n    print(\"\\tAverage time to goal:\", tmp.groupby(\"event_id\")[\"event_time\"].agg(\"first\").mean())\n    print(\"\\tTeam A scores:\", tmp.groupby(\"event_id\")[\"team_A_scoring_within_10sec\"].agg(\"first\").mean())\n    print()\n\n\nActive players team A: 1\n    Average time to goal: -56.19182\n    Team A scores: 0.02766798418972332\n\nActive players team A: 2\n    Average time to goal: -52.985264\n    Team A scores: 0.057919015889287544\n\nActive players team A: 3\n    Average time to goal: -36.29622\n    Team A scores: 0.13558903432946406\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer velocity\nThe velocity of player i is given by the corresponding p{i}_vel_[xyz] features. Again the histograms of players of the same team are identical, while the histograms of the opposing team are mirror images. The maximum velocity of a player in each dimension is 46.0 (slightly lower for z).\nThe most interesting histogram below is the one belonging to the y direction. Naturally, players are more often attacking than defending. But if a player drives at maximum speed it is more likely to be for the purpose of defending than attacking.\n\n\nCode\nprint(\"Player velocity (min/max):\")\nfor coord in [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]:\n    mi, ma = df[f\"p0_vel_{coord}\"].min(), df[f\"p0_vel_{coord}\"].max()\n    print(f\"{coord} coordinate: min = {mi:.3f}\\t max = {ma:.3f}\")\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 3))\nfor ax, f in zip(axs.ravel(), [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    ax.hist(df[f\"p0_vel_{f}\"], bins=100)\n    ax.set_xlabel(f, fontsize=12)\nfig.tight_layout()\nfig.suptitle(\"Player 0 (team A)\")\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(14, 3))\nfor ax, f in zip(axs.ravel(), [\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    ax.hist(df[f\"p3_vel_{f}\"], bins=100)\n    ax.set_xlabel(f, fontsize=12)\nfig.suptitle(\"Player 3 (team B)\")\nfig.tight_layout()\n\n\nPlayer velocity (min/max):\nx coordinate: min = -46.000  max = 46.000\ny coordinate: min = -46.000  max = 46.000\nz coordinate: min = -45.953  max = 45.400\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer velocity and goal scoring\nWhen looking at the player velocity in the last time intervals before a goal, we can see that attacking players show an increasing y velocity while the z velocity tends to decrease. This holds true for defending players, even though to a lesser extent. For the x velocity, extreme values become increasingly less common the closer we get to the goal.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(14, 6), sharex=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, c in enumerate([\"x\", \"y\", \"z\"]):\n    axs[1][col].set_xlabel(f\"{c} velocity\")\n    axs[0][col].axvline(0, color=\"black\", lw=0.5)\n    axs[1][col].axvline(0, color=\"black\", lw=0.5)\n    for interval in intervals:\n        tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n        tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n        m = abs(interval[0] + interval[1])/2\n        axs[0][col].scatter(tmp[f\"p0_vel_{c}\"], np.repeat(m, tmp.shape[0]), s=7.5, alpha=.005, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n        axs[1][col].scatter(tmp[f\"p3_vel_{c}\"], np.repeat(m, tmp.shape[0]), s=7.5, alpha=.005, color=\"#a60717\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting two dimensions against each other reveals further interesting patterns. When looking at the left column (x versus y) we can see that there are two rings corresponding to the maximum velocity with and without boost. In the last seconds before a goal attacking players tend to use boost in the y direction.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 3, figsize=(10, 12), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor row, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[row][0].scatter(tmp.p0_vel_x, tmp.p0_vel_y, s=0.1, alpha=0.1, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][0].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n    axs[row][0].set_ylabel(\"y\")\n    axs[row][1].scatter(tmp.p0_vel_x, tmp.p0_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.1, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][1].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n    axs[row][1].set_ylabel(\"z\")\n    axs[row][2].scatter(tmp.p0_vel_y, tmp.p0_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.1, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][2].set_xlabel(\"y\")\n    axs[row][2].set_ylabel(\"z\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing this to the scatterplots for team B shows two things:\n\ndefending players are more likely to use boost for maximum velocity when rushing back to defend their own goal (this is probably a very good indicator for an imminent goal)\ndefending players make significantly less use of the z dimension in the last seconds before a goal than attacking players\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 3, figsize=(10, 12), sharex=True, sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor row, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[row][0].scatter(tmp.p3_vel_x, tmp.p3_vel_y, s=0.1, alpha=0.1, color=\"#a60717\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][0].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n    axs[row][0].set_ylabel(\"y\")\n    axs[row][1].scatter(tmp.p3_vel_x, tmp.p3_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.1, color=\"#a60717\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][1].set_xlabel(\"x\")\n    axs[row][1].set_ylabel(\"z\")\n    axs[row][2].scatter(tmp.p3_vel_y, tmp.p3_vel_z, s=0.1, alpha=0.1, color=\"#a60717\")\n    if row == 4: axs[row][2].set_xlabel(\"y\")\n    axs[row][2].set_ylabel(\"z\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer boost\nFor each player i, the remaining boost (a value between 0 and 100) is provided in the p{i}_boost feature. Using boost increases a player’s speed and is required to go up in the z dimension. The histogram (similar for all players) shows that it is quite common for players to have no boost or full boost available. Still, players tend to use their boost in the course of the game which explains the overall uniform distribution between 0 and 100 (even though the two peaks in the lower half of the value range are striking; they are probably due to the minor boost pads which are not captured in the dataset).\n\n\nCode\ndf.p0_boost.plot.hist(bins=100, figsize=(4, 3));\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer boost and goal scoring\nWe again look at the last seconds before a goal to see whether there are useful patterns and indeed there are:\n\nPlayers of both teams (attacking as well as defending) tend to use boost in the last seconds before a goal.\nMembers of the attacking team more often use up all their boost than defending players.\nMembers of the defending team more often have used up all their boost when a goal is imminent than attacking players.\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 5, figsize=(16, 8), sharey=True)\nintervals = [(-7, -6), (-5, -4), (-3, -2), (-2, -1), (-1, -0.1)]\nfor col, interval in enumerate(intervals):\n    tmp = df[(df.event_time &gt;= interval[0]) & (df.event_time &lt;= interval[1])]\n    tmp = tmp[tmp.team_A_scoring_within_10sec == 1]\n    axs[0][col].hist(tmp.p0_boost, bins=50, color=\"#0f0cb3\")\n    axs[0][col].set_title(f\"Goal scored in the next {abs(interval[0])} to {abs(interval[1])} secs\")\n    axs[1][col].hist(tmp.p3_boost, bins=50, color=\"#a60717\")\nfig.tight_layout();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe target\nThe target is quite imbalanced: team A will score in 10 seconds in only 5.6% of our observations.\n\n\nCode\ndf.team_A_scoring_within_10sec.value_counts() / len(df)\n\n\n0    0.943058\n1    0.056942\nName: team_A_scoring_within_10sec, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nBy now, we’ve gained a thorough understanding of the dataset and gathered many ideas that will be useful for feature engineering: computing distance measures for player positions in relation to the ball and goals, using the different patterns in player velocity and boost utilization, exploiting missing values, etc.\nOf course, there are still many possibilities for exploration left and we didn’t use all techniques out there. But we can (and will) always come back to analyzing our data further as our understanding of the data evolves (i.e., when we find interesting new patterns or features).\nIn the next post, we’ll go into the theory and practice of validating and evaluating our models."

Given the hype around the model and its (arguably) attractive price of $0.002/1,000 tokens (one tenth of the GPT3-API with the text-davinci-003 endpoint), it isn’t surprising that many companies have already introduced ChatGPT’s conversational capabilties into their products.

As per the OpenAI docs, a simple API call using only the two required parameters model and messages looks like this:\nopenai.ChatCompletion.create(\n  model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n  messages=[\n        {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"},\n        {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"},\n        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Where was it played?\"}\n    ]\n)\nThe important input is the message parameter which is a list of message objects. Apart from the message content, we have to define a role for each message object. This is interesting since we cannot specify any roles in the web UI. In the API, three roles are available:\n\nsystem: By specifying content for the system role, we can give the model some general instructions about how to behave. This is usually done once at the beginning of a conversation.\nuser: The user role belongs to the prompt of the end-user.\nassistant: The assistant role can be used to give ChatGPT examples of desired behavior or help store prior responses.\n\nA conversation generally consists of alternating user and assistant messages.

Let’s write some custom classes with fixed prompts to prime ChatGPT for certain use cases.\n\nText Summarization\nCrafting the prompt for text summarization is not really difficult. What often seems to help though is putting important instructions in all caps and/or repeat them.

Putin’s war in Ukraine has destabilised energy markets and supply chains the world over. I want to pay tribute to my predecessor Liz Truss, she was not wrong to want to improve growth in this country, it is a noble aim. And I admired her restlessness to create change. But some mistakes were made. Not borne of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite, in fact. But mistakes nonetheless. And I have been elected as leader of my party, and your Prime Minister, in part, to fix them.  And that work begins immediately.  I will place economic stability and confidence at the heart of this government's agenda.   This will mean difficult decisions to come. But you saw me during Covid, doing everything I could, to protect people and businesses, with schemes like furlough. There are always limits, more so now than ever, but I promise you this I will bring that same compassion to the challenges we face today. The government I lead will not leave the next generation, your children and grandchildren, with a debt to settle that we were too weak to pay ourselves. I will unite our country, not with words, but with action. I will work day in and day out to deliver for you. This government will have integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level. Trust is earned. And I will earn yours. I will always be grateful to Boris Johnson for his incredible achievements as Prime Minister, and I treasure his warmth and generosity of spirit. And I know he would agree that the mandate my party earned in 2019 is not the sole property of any one individual, it is a mandate that belongs to and unites all of us. And the heart of that mandate is our manifesto. I will deliver on its promise. A stronger NHS. Better schools. Safer streets. Control of our borders. Protecting our environment. Supporting our armed forces. Levelling up and building an economy that embraces the opportunities of Brexit, where businesses invest, innovate, and create jobs.  I understand how difficult this moment is. After the billions of pounds it cost us to combat Covid, after all the dislocation that caused in the midst of a terrible war that must be seen successfully to its conclusions I fully appreciate how hard things are. And I understand too that I have work to do to restore trust after all that has happened. All I can say is that I am not daunted. I know the high office I have accepted and I hope to live up to its demands.  But when the opportunity to serve comes along, you cannot question the moment, only your willingness. So I stand here before you ready to lead our country into the future. To put your needs above politics. To reach out and build a government that represents the very best traditions of my party. Together we can achieve incredible things. We will create a future worthy of the sacrifices so many have made and fill tomorrow, and everyday thereafter with hope.

    "section": "The Problem",
    "text": "The Problem\nIn Germany it has been a matter of fierce debate whether patients whose deaths were officially reported as being “associated with Covid-19” have died due to or with Covid-19. Providing a reliable answer to this question boils down to estimating excess mortality. The total number of recorded deaths is not only readily available but also unaffected by the (quite contentious) definition of Covid-19 deaths, and can therefore serve as an objective metric.\nIt turns out that the common approach is to compare weekly mortality numbers of the year in question with the median of some reference years. The Federal Statistical Office of Germany (destatis), for example, estimates excess mortality by comparing weekly deaths of a given year with the weekly median of the four previous years, yielding figures like the one that I recreated below for the year 2022 (see here for the analysis by destatis).\n\n\nCode\ndef plot_compare_past(df, year):\n    df_year = df[df.year == year][[\"week\", \"deaths_total\", \"covid_deaths\"]]\n    df_past = df[df.year.isin(range(year - 4, year))].groupby(\"week\").deaths_total.agg([\"min\", \"median\", \"max\"]).reset_index()\n    if df_year.shape[0] &gt; df_past.shape[0]:\n        week53 = pd.DataFrame(df_past.iloc[0]).T\n        week53[\"week\"] = 53\n        df_past = pd.concat([df_past, week53])\n    elif df_year.shape[0] &lt; df_past.shape[0]:\n        df_past = df_past.iloc[:-1]\n    \n    _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 3))\n    ax.plot(df_year.week, df_year.deaths_total, color=\"#ec4c62\", zorder=5, label=f\"{year}\")\n    if year &gt; 2019:\n        ax.plot(df_year.week, df_year.covid_deaths, color=\"#ec4c62\", marker=\"o\", markersize=3, label=f\"{year} Covid-19\")\n    ax.plot(df_past.week, df_past[\"median\"], color=\"#005890\", lw=.75, zorder=4, label=f\"{year-4}-{year-1} median\")\n    ax.fill_between(df_past.week, df_past[\"min\"], df_past[\"max\"], color=\"#acddfd\", alpha=0.75, zorder=3, label=f\"{year-4}-{year-1} min/max\")\n\n    for spine in [\"top\", \"right\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n    for spine in [\"left\", \"bottom\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_linewidth(0.5)\n\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"calendar week\", fontsize=9.5)\n    ax.set_ylabel(\"weekly\\ndeaths\", rotation=\"horizontal\", labelpad=25, fontsize=9.5)\n    ax.set_xlim((0.5, df_past.shape[0] + 0.5))\n    ax.set_ylim((0, 34_000))\n    ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(MultipleLocator(1))\n    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(5))\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(5_000))\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: format(int(x), ',')))\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"minor\", labelbottom=False)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"major\", labelsize=9)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"y\", which=\"major\", left=False, labelsize=9, pad=5)\n    ax.yaxis.grid(True, which=\"major\", color=\"#e6e6e6\", zorder=-10)\n    ax.legend(loc=\"upper center\", prop={\"size\": 8}, facecolor=\"white\", edgecolor=\"white\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_compare_past(df, 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this approach can certainly help detect major patterns in mortality during the course of a year, there are two drawbacks worth considering:\n\nThe comparison solely depends on the mortality in the reference years which leads to arbitrary weekly patterns and limited comparability across a broader timeframe and across countries. When it comes to estimating excess mortality due to Covid-19, the approach will fail at the latest when the reference years have already been impacted by Covid-19.\nBy design the method doesn’t consider the influence of other factors which are known to impact mortality rates. For instance, not taking the aging of Germany’s population into account will inevitably lead to an overestimation of excess mortality (the aging is only partly offset by an increase in life expectancy). There are papers which tried to mitigate this by extrapolating from the reference years (e.g., see here and here), but they still neglect other important effects.\n\nSo can we build a model explicitly for estimating Covid-19 excess mortality? Before we get into the specifics, it is essential to establish a precise understanding of what we actually mean by “Covid-19 excess mortality”. Excess deaths due to Covid-19 are deaths that would not have occurred if Covid-19 had not appeared. Expressed mathematically, excess deaths are the difference between actual deaths and expected deaths.\nBut since expected deaths are an unmeasurable quantity this appears to be simpler than it actually is. The crucial question now is: How many deaths should we expect? Or, more precisely and with our specific problem in mind: How many deaths should we expect in a counterfactual scenario with no pandemic? To see the point, let’s pause and think only about the role of seasonal influenza. The severity of the yearly influenza wave depends on many factors and is therefore very hard to predict. In some years (e.g., 2014) the wave is mild, while in other years (e.g., 2018) the death toll is very high. Intuitively, one would probably assert that influenza led to no or very few excess deaths in 2014, while the severe wave of 2018 led to significant excess mortality. So how many deaths should we expect for, say, 2021? Following the intuition that we just developed, our expectation should depend on the severity of the flu wave in 2021. Thus, given that Covid-19 mitigation measures like mask mandates and social distancing had the side effect of virtually no flu cases, we shouldn’t expect any influenza-related deaths. This brings us back to the problems of the baseline approach outlined earlier. If we compared 2021 with the median of the four previous years, the estimated excess deaths would be heavily biased by the flu activity in these years. (The same logic applies to other factors like temperature, of course.) Indeed, a 2022 study found that the choice of baseline years is highly influential for the resulting estimate of excess deaths. In Germany, using the four previous years as a baseline would lead to a significant undercount of Covid-19 deaths.\nThus, what we’ll do instead is build a model that is trained on data before the spread of Covid-19 and capable of accurately predicting weekly mortality figures. We’ll use this model to create a counterfactual forecast of mortality for the years impacted by Covid-19 which we will then compare with the number of deaths that were actually reported. Naturally, this approach still has limitations (which are exacerbated by data availability issues); in particular, the number of excess deaths will not only include deaths that were directly caused by the virus, but also deaths that were caused indirectly (e.g., due to worse access to health care) or even indirectly prevented (e.g., less traffic accidents during lockdowns). We should keep this in mind when analyzing our results later."

Meanwhile it is quite hard to see (at least at first glance) whether the years 2020-2022 really are exceptional.\n\n\nCode\nax = get_plot(ylabel=\"weekly deaths per 100,000 people\")\nax.plot(pre_df.date, pre_df.deaths_per100k, color=\"#0e448a\", zorder=2)\nax.plot(post_df.date, post_df.deaths_per100k, color=\"#991608\", zorder=2)\nax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.YearLocator())\nax.set_xlim([pre_df.date.min() - timedelta(days=50), post_df.date.max() + timedelta(days=100)])\nax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"both\", rotation=45);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonality\nLet’s have a closer look at the seasonality. To get a better grasp of the seasonal patterns, we can plot the number of deaths for all years in pre_df by calendar week.\nA lot of the seasonality that we can see here has probably to do with temperature effects. As even moderately cold temperatures are known to worsen pre-existing medical conditions like cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, it is not surprising that more deaths are recorded in winter. However, the peaks in summer show that heat waves take their toll too.\nThe high mortality in February/March reflects the peaks of flu season. Apart from that the seasonality surely involves other effects that are more loosely related to temperature (e.g., seasonal activities or traffic conditions that are associated with higher mortality).\nFinally note that the color-coding of the years highlights the rise in mortality over the years once more.\n\n\nCode\nax = get_plot(ylabel=\"weekly deaths per 100,000 people\")\nsns.lineplot(data=pre_df, \n             x=\"week\", \n             y=\"deaths_per100k\", \n             hue=\"year\", \n             palette=sns.cubehelix_palette(start=.2, rot=-.3, as_cmap=True))\nax.xaxis.set_major_locator(MultipleLocator(5))\nax.set_xlim(1, 54)\nhandles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()\nax.legend(handles=handles[::-1], \n          labels=labels[::-1], \n          facecolor=\"white\", \n          edgecolor=\"white\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperature\nThe relationship between the number of deaths and mean temperature is quite clear. While moderate temperatures are associated with the lowest mortality, colder temperatures and excessive heat increase the number of deaths.\n\n\nCode\nax = get_plot(xlabel=\"mean temperature\", ylabel=\"weekly deaths per 100,000 people\")\nax.scatter(pre_df.mean_temp, pre_df.deaths_per100k, color=\"#4c88d4\", edgecolor=\"#020e78\", alpha=0.8, s=20, zorder=2);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfluenza\nFinally, let’s have a look at influenza. We can plot the number of flu cases (here only the age groups 75-79 and 80+) against the number of weekly deaths:\n\n\nCode\nax = get_plot(xlabel=\"number of flu cases (log scale)\", ylabel=\"weekly deaths per 100,000 people\")\nax.scatter(np.log(pre_df[pre_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].flu_cases_75_79_per100k), pre_df[pre_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].deaths_per100k, color=\"#4c88d4\", edgecolor=\"#020e78\", alpha=0.65, s=20, zorder=2, label=\"age group 75-79\");\nax.scatter(np.log(pre_df[pre_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].flu_cases_gt80_per100k), pre_df[pre_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].deaths_per100k, color=\"#0e448a\", edgecolor=\"#03093b\", alpha=0.65, s=20, zorder=2, label=\"age group 80+\");\nax.legend(facecolor=\"white\", edgecolor=\"white\");\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the case numbers will likely be useful predictors. Also, note that influenza is highly seasonal and there were very few cases in the years affected by Covid-19:\n\n\nCode\nax = get_plot(ylabel=\"number of cases\")\nax.plot(pre_df[pre_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].date, pre_df[pre_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].flu_cases, color=\"#4c88d4\", zorder=2)\nax.plot(post_df[post_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].date, post_df[post_df.flu_cases &gt; 0].flu_cases, color=\"#4c88d4\", zorder=2)\nax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.YearLocator());"

    "text": "The Base Model\nAs advertised, we’ll tackle our problem with a Bayesian model (in particular, a Bayesian linear regression model) specified with PyMC. Using a Bayesian model comes with two great advantages: A natural and principled way to incorporate prior knowledge and an intuitive way to quantify uncertainty with probabilities.\nWe’ll begin with a model for Germany. I’ll spare the reader from the iterative process that ultimately resulted in the model presented below, but let’s go over the main modeling and feature selection choices:\n\nTo model the seasonality we use PyMC’s nifty ZeroSumNormal distribution for monthly effects (month_mu). This means that the monthly effects will sum to zero improving both parameter identifiability and interpretability.\nThe effect of mean temperature (temp) on mortality is modeled using splines. We’ve already seen why this should improve model performance when we plotted mean temperature against weekly deaths. See here and here for great resources on splines.\nA little research (e.g., this paper) showed that while heat waves affect mortality quite immediately, the effect of cold temperatures can have a considerable lag. For this reason we add two dummy variables that indicate whether the average minimum temperature of the last and second last week was below 0 degrees Celsius (temp_lag1 and temp_lag2).\nTo factor in the age of the German population we include the population share of the age groups 70-74, 75-79, and 80+ (age_70, age_75, and age_80). We center these features for better interpretability.\nThe last main block of features concerns the role of influenza/other diseases. While we use the number of cases in the age groups 75-79 and 80+ of the previous week for influenza (flu_7579_lag1, flu_gt80_lag1), we use the case numbers of the current week for the generic category of other viral or bacterial diseases (disease_7579, disease_gt80). (These features are all standardized for easier interpretability.) For both categories we also include the number of cases reported in the last year ([flu/disease]_last_year) since population-level immunity obtained in a given year tends to dampen the severity of next year’s wave.\nFinally, we include some interactions that should further improve the model: temp:flu, flu:disease, and disease:age_80 (where flu/disease represent the weekly number of cases per 100,000 people for each category).\n\nSpecifying this model with reasonable priors in PyMC is fairly straightforward. Note that we wrap the model building in a factory function to make our life a lot easier when we compute the counterfactual forecast for the years affected by Covid-19.\n\n\nCode\ndef create_model(pre_df, post_df, infer_post=False):\n\n    df = pre_df if not infer_post else post_df\n\n    knot_list = np.quantile(pre_df.mean_temp, np.linspace(0, 1, 5))\n    B = dmatrix(\"0 + bs(mean_temp, knots=knots, degree=2, include_intercept=True)\",\n                {\"mean_temp\": df.mean_temp.values, \"knots\": knot_list[1:-1]})\n\n    coords = {\n        \"month\": calendar.month_name[1:],\n        \"splines\": np.arange(B.shape[1])\n    }\n\n    with pm.Model(coords=coords) as model:\n\n        # observed data\n        month = pm.MutableData(\"month\", df[\"month\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        temp = pm.MutableData(\"temp\", df[\"mean_temp_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        temp_lag1 = pm.MutableData(\"temp lag1\", df[\"min_lt0_lag1\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        temp_lag2 = pm.MutableData(\"temp lag2\", df[\"min_lt0_lag2\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        age_70 = pm.MutableData(\"age 70-75\", df[\"pop_share_70_74_cnt\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        age_75 = pm.MutableData(\"age 75-80\", df[\"pop_share_75_79_cnt\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        age_80 = pm.MutableData(\"age 80+\", df[\"pop_share_gt80_cnt\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        flu = pm.MutableData(\"flu cases per 100k\", df[\"flu_cases_per100k_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        flu_75_lag1 = pm.MutableData(\"flu cases age 75-79 per 100k lag1\", df[\"flu_cases_75_79_per100k_lag1_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        flu_80_lag1 = pm.MutableData(\"flu cases age 80+ per 100k lag1\", df[\"flu_cases_gt80_per100k_lag1_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        flu_last_year = pm.MutableData(\"flu cases last year\", df[\"flu_last_year_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        disease = pm.MutableData(\"disease cases per 100k\", df[\"disease_cases_per100k_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        disease_75 = pm.MutableData(\"disease cases age 75-79 per 100k\", df[\"disease_cases_75_79_per100k_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        disease_80 = pm.MutableData(\"disease cases age 80+ per 100k\", df[\"disease_cases_gt80_per100k_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        disease_last_year = pm.MutableData(\"disease last year\", df[\"disease_last_year_st\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n        deaths = pm.MutableData(\"deaths per 100k\", df[\"deaths_per100k\"].to_numpy(), dims=\"obs_id\")\n\n        # priors\n        intercept = pm.Normal(\"intercept\", mu=20, sigma=1)\n        month_mu = pm.ZeroSumNormal(\"month mu\", sigma=2, dims=\"month\")\n        w = pm.Normal(\"w\", mu=0, sigma=3, size=B.shape[1], dims=\"splines\")\n        temp_lag1_coeff = pm.Normal(\"temp lag1 coeff\", mu=0.5, sigma=0.2)\n        temp_lag2_coeff = pm.Normal(\"temp lag2 coeff\", mu=0.5, sigma=0.2)\n        age_70_coeff = pm.Normal(\"age 70-75 coeff\", mu=0.3, sigma=0.2)\n        age_75_coeff = pm.Normal(\"age 75-80 coeff\", mu=0.5, sigma=0.2)\n        age_80_coeff = pm.Normal(\"age 80+ coeff\", mu=0.7, sigma=0.2)\n        flu_75_lag1_coeff = pm.Normal(\"flu cases 75-79 per 100k lag1 coeff\", mu=0.1, sigma=0.1)\n        flu_80_lag1_coeff = pm.Normal(\"flu cases 80+ per 100k lag1 coeff\", mu=0.2, sigma=0.1)\n        flu_last_year_coeff = pm.Normal(\"flu last year coeff\", mu=-0.2, sigma=0.1)\n        disease_75_coeff = pm.Normal(\"disease cases 75-79 per 100k coeff\", mu=0.1, sigma=0.1)\n        disease_80_coeff = pm.Normal(\"disease cases 80+ per 100k coeff\", mu=0.2, sigma=0.1)\n        disease_last_year_coeff = pm.Normal(\"disease last year coeff\", mu=-0.2, sigma=0.1)\n        temp_flu_coeff = pm.Normal(\"temp:flu coeff\", mu=0.2, sigma=0.1)\n        flu_disease_coeff = pm.Normal(\"flu:disease coeff\", mu=0.2, sigma=0.1)\n        disease_age_80_coeff = pm.Normal(\"disease:age80 coeff\", mu=0.2, sigma=0.1)\n        \n        # model\n        mu = pm.Deterministic(\"mu\", intercept + \\\n                                    month_mu[month -

Nonetheless, one issue catches the eye: the model struggles with the peaks of flu season.\nPlotting the residuals confirms this suspicion. In more than a few years the model either under- or overestimates mortality at the peak of flu season. Because influenza waves tend to vary in their severity (e.g., due to the changing mix of strains in circulation and the match of the vaccines to these strains), this should probably be expected to some extent, though. Apart from that there is still some amount of variance left in the data that is not quite captured by the model. Given the data constraints this isn’t surprising, but still a finding to be aware of.\n\n\nCode\ndef plot_residuals(idata, pre_df, hdi_prob_low=0.5, hdi_prob_high=0.95):\n    residuals = idata.observed_data.obs - idata.posterior_predictive.obs\n    hdi_high = az.hdi(residuals, hdi_prob=hdi_prob_high)\n    hdi_low = az.hdi(residuals, hdi_prob=hdi_prob_low)\n\n    _, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 4))\n    for spine in [\"top\", \"right\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n    for spine in [\"bottom\", \"left\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_linewidth(1.5)\n    ax.set_title(f\"Residuals\", fontsize=12, pad=10)\n    ax.grid(axis=\"y\", color=\"#f0f0f0\", zorder=1)\n    ax.axhline(0, color=\"black\", lw=1., zorder=2)\n    ax.fill_between(pre_df.date, hdi_high.sel(hdi=\"lower\").obs, hdi_high.sel(hdi=\"higher\").obs, color=\"#a3c0ff\", alpha=0.8, zorder=3)\n    ax.fill_between(pre_df.date, hdi_low.sel(hdi=\"lower\").obs, hdi_low.sel(hdi=\"higher\").obs, color=\"#7399eb\", alpha=0.8, zorder=4)\n    ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(mdates.MonthLocator((1, 4, 7, 10)))\n    ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter(\"%b\"))\n    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.YearLocator())\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: format(int(x), ',')))\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"minor\", labelbottom=False)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"major\", rotation=45)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"major\", labelsize=10.5)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"y\", which=\"major\", labelsize=10.5)\n    ax.set_xlim(pre_df.date.min() - timedelta(days=10), pre_df.date.max() + timedelta(days=30))\n    ax.set_ylim(-6, 6);\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplot_residuals(idata, pre_df)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCounterfactual inference\nFinally we can move on to the most interesting part: the counterfactual forecast of mortality.

Note that we include the estimate for some months prior to the rise of Covid-19 for better comparison (for these months it is of course the retrodiction, not the counterfactual).\n\n\nCode\ndef get_posterior_predictive(idata,\n                             counterfactual,\n                             pre_df,\n                             post_df,\n                             hdi_prob_low=0.5, \n                             hdi_prob_high=0.9):\n    pre_hdi_df = get_hdi_df(idata.posterior_predictive.obs, hdi_prob_low, hdi_prob_high)\n    pre_cols = (pre_df.iloc[pre_hdi_df.obs_id.values]\n                      .loc[:, [\"population\", \"deaths_total\", \"deaths_per100k\", \"covid_deaths_per100k\", \"year\", \"week\", \"date\"]]\n                      .reset_index(drop=True))\n    pre_hdi_df = pd.concat([pre_hdi_df, pre_cols], axis=1)\n\n    post_hdi_df = get_hdi_df(counterfactual.posterior_predictive.obs, hdi_prob_low, hdi_prob_high)\n    post_cols = (post_df.iloc[post_hdi_df.obs_id.values]\n                        .loc[:, [\"population\", \"deaths_total\", \"deaths_per100k\", \"covid_deaths_per100k\", \"year\", \"week\", \"date\"]]\n                        .reset_index(drop=True))\n    post_hdi_df = pd.concat([post_hdi_df, post_cols], axis=1)\n\n    return pd.concat([pre_hdi_df, post_hdi_df], axis=0)\n\ndef plot_posterior_predictive(idata, \n                              counterfactual, \n                              pre_df, \n                              post_df,\n                              years=[2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022],\n                              hdi_prob_low=0.5,\n                              hdi_prob_high=0.95,\n                              absolute=False,\n                              response_measures=False,\n                              dominant_voc=False):\n    df = get_posterior_predictive(idata, counterfactual, pre_df, post_df, hdi_prob_low=hdi_prob_low, hdi_prob_high=hdi_prob_high)\n    first_date = df.date.max() - timedelta(days=365 * (len(years)-1))\n    df = df.loc[df.date &gt;= first_date]\n    first_month = df.date.dt.month.iloc[0]\n    first_year = df.date.dt.year.iloc[0]\n    \n    # Setup figure\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 6))\n    for spine in [\"top\", \"right\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)\n    for spine in [\"bottom\", \"left\"]:\n        ax.spines[spine].set_linewidth(1.5)\n    ax.set_title(f\"Counterfactual estimate and actual deaths since {first_month}/{first_year}\", fontsize=13.5, pad=20)\n    ax.grid(axis=\"y\", which=\"major\", color=\"#e6e5e3\", zorder=1)\n    ax.xaxis.set_minor_locator(mdates.MonthLocator((1, 4, 7, 10)))\n    ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter(\"%b\"))\n    ax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.YearLocator())\n    ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(FuncFormatter(lambda x, p: format(int(x), ',')))\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"both\", rotation=45)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"minor\", labelsize=10)\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"major\", labelsize=10.5)\n    ax.set_xlim([first_date + timedelta(days=10), df.date.max() + timedelta(days=150)])\n    ax.tick_params(axis=\"y\", which=\"major\", labelsize=10.5)\n\n    if not absolute:\n        ax.fill_between(df[df.year &lt;

Let’s go through this chronologically: After the first (and in hindsight small) wave, the first summer of the pandemic saw low case numbers in Germany and therefore virtually no excess deaths (the one major spike was likely due to a heat wave and expected by the model). In the fall of 2020 case numbers started to rise again, culminating in the second wave which was associated with a high increase in mortality. This repeated itself in the fall and winter of 2021 when the third wave led to a significant number of excess deaths. Since then mortality still appears to follow anomalous patterns. For the last weeks of 2022, however, we should remind ourselves that the model probably significantly underestimates the severity of the flu wave. This wasn’t an issue during most months of the Covid-19 pandemic (since there were virtually no flu cases), but towards the end of the year 2022 flu cases actually soared for the first time since its beginning and the wave was described as quite severe (probably due to the waning immunity of the population).\nLet’s change the perspective and look specifically at excess mortality since 2020:\n\n\nCode\ndef get_excess_deaths(counterfactual, year=None, month=None):\n    if year is None:\n        cf = counterfactual.posterior_predictive.obs\n        deaths = xr.DataArray(post_df[\"deaths_per100k\"].to_numpy(), dims=[\"obs_id\"])\n    else:\n        if month is None:\n            cf = counterfactual.posterior_predictive.obs.isel(obs_id=post_df[post_df.year == year].index)\n            deaths = xr.DataArray(post_df[post_df.year == year][\"deaths_per100k\"].to_numpy(), dims=[\"obs_id\"])\n        else:\n            cf = counterfactual.posterior_predictive.obs.isel(obs_id=post_df[(post_df.year == year) & (post_df.month == month)].index)\n            deaths = xr.DataArray(post_df[(post_df.year == year) & (post_df.month == month)][\"deaths_per100k\"].to_numpy(), dims=[\"obs_id\"])\n    excess_deaths = deaths -

However, in weeks with many Covid-19 deaths (around the peaks of the infection waves) actual mortality figures appear to have been higher than what was officially recorded. In these weeks, many hospitals were running at full capacity, so Covid-19 may have been (at least in part) the indirect rather than the direct cause of these additional deaths. In any case, we can probably conclude that excess mortality due to Covid-19 hasn’t been significantly overestimated in Germany."

    "text": "The Hierarchical Model\nUntil now we have looked at the aggregated data for Germany, but the title of this blog post promised a hierarchical model. So let’s build a hierarchical model for estimating excess mortality in the German states! Why a hierarchical model? The alternatives would be either a complete pooled model, which assumes that one model is appropriate for estimating mortality in all states, or an unpooled model, which assumes that a model for one state doesn’t contain information that is relevant for other states. Given that the German states are quite similar but certainly differ to some degree in relevant aspects (population density, access to and quality of health care, geography, etc.), a hierarchical model is the better choice.\n\n\nCode\ndef standardize_by_state(pre_df, post_df, feature):\n    pre_st = np.zeros(pre_df.shape[0])\n    post_st = np.zeros(post_df.shape[0])\n\n    for state in df[\"state\"].unique():\n        pre_mask = pre_df[\"state\"] == state\n        post_mask = post_df[\"state\"] == state\n        pre_vals = pre_df.loc[pre_mask, feature]\n        post_vals = post_df.loc[post_mask, feature]\n\n        ss = StandardScaler()\n        ss.fit(pre_vals.values.reshape(-1, 1))\n\n        pre_st[pre_mask] = ss.transform(pre_vals.values.reshape(-1, 1)).ravel()\n        post_st[post_mask] = ss.transform(post_vals.values.reshape(-1, 1)).ravel()\n    \n    return pre_st, post_st\n\ndef create_datasets(df):\n    df[\"is_pre_covid\"] = df[\"year\"] &lt; 2020\n\n    df = df.loc[df.year.isin(range(2010, 2023))]\n\n    pre_df = df[df[\"is_pre_covid\"]].copy()\n    post_df = df[~df[\"is_pre_covid\"]].copy()\n\n    for feature in [\"mean_temp\", \n                    \"pop_share_70\",\n                    \"pop_share_75\",\n                    \"pop_share_80\",\n                    \"flu_cases_per100k\", \n                    \"flu_cases_per100k_lag1\",\n                    \"flu_cases_75_per100k\",\n                    \"flu_cases_75_per100k_lag1\",\n                    \"flu_cases_80_per100k\",\n                    \"flu_cases_80_per100k_lag1\",\n                    \"flu_cases_last_year\",\n                    \"disease_cases_per100k\",\n                    \"disease_cases_per100k_lag1\",\n                    \"disease_cases_75_per100k\",\n                    \"disease_cases_75_per100k_lag1\",\n                    \"disease_cases_80_per100k\",\n                    \"disease_cases_80_per100k_lag1\",\n                    \"disease_cases_last_year\"]:\n        pre_df[f\"{feature}_st\"], post_df[f\"{feature}_st\"] =  standardize_by_state(pre_df, post_df, feature)\n\n    return pre_df, post_df\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata_path = Path(\"../data/final/states.ftr\")\nmap_path = Path(\"../data/final/maps\")\nabbr_path = Path(\"../data/raw/states/abbr2name.pkl\")\n\nwith open(abbr_path, \"rb\") as f:\n    abbr2name = pickle.load(f)\n\ndf = pd.read_feather(data_path)\npre_df, post_df = create_datasets(df.copy())\n\n\nLet’s have a quick look at the data again (no worries, we’ll keep this much more concise).\nFor example, let’s plot the mortality figures of Bavaria, the state with the highest GDP per capita (at least when we ignore the city-states of Bremen and Hamburg), and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the state with the lowest GDP per capita. As we can see, the difference between states can be quite distinct. (There are many reasons for this; the different age structure probably being the most important one.)\n\n\nCode\npre_by, post_by = pre_df[pre_df.state == \"by\"].copy(), post_df[post_df.state == \"by\"].copy()\npre_mv, post_mv = pre_df[pre_df.state == \"mv\"].copy(), post_df[post_df.state == \"mv\"].copy()\n\nax = get_plot(ylabel=\"weekly deaths per 100,000 people\")\nax.plot(pre_by.date, pre_by.deaths_per100k, color=\"#5b62ba\", zorder=2, label=\"Bavaria\")\nax.plot(post_by.date, post_by.deaths_per100k, color=\"#5b62ba\", zorder=2)\nax.plot(pre_mv.date, pre_mv.deaths_per100k, color=\"#715394\", zorder=2, label=\"Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\")\nax.plot(post_mv.date, post_mv.deaths_per100k, color=\"#715394\", zorder=2)\nax.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.YearLocator())\nax.set_xlim([pre_df.date.min() - timedelta(days=50), post_df.date.max() + timedelta(days=100)])\nax.tick_params(axis=\"x\", which=\"both\", rotation=45)\nax.legend();\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s continue with the definition of the model. The key idea in hierarchical models is that groups don’t share a fixed parameter but a hyperprior distribution which describes the distribution of the prior’s parameters. Thus, each group has its own prior parameters which are drawn from a common hyperprior distribution. If you need more information, the PyMC documentation includes a nice primer on hierarchical Bayesian models and a handful of examples for different topics. For more info regarding model reparameterization see here and here.\n\n\nCode\ndef create_model(pre_df, post_df, infer_post=False, num_knots=5):\n\n    # Define the dataset\n    df = pre_df if not

    "title": "Few-shot Sentiment Analysis with ChatGPT",
    "section": "Prompting ChatGPT",
    "text": "Prompting ChatGPT\nWe can tweak multiple parameters to prime ChatGPT for our use case; the most important one unquestionably being the system prompt. Let’s try the following:\n\n\nCode\nsystem_prompt = \"\"\"You are a helpful assistant. Your task is sentiment analysis. \nClassify the sentiment of the user's text with ONLY ONE of the following emotions:\n- joy\n- love\n- fear\n- anger\n- sadness\n- surprise\n\nAfter classifying a text, always end your reply with \".\".\n\"\"\"\n\n\nTo ensure that ChatGPT only replies with one of the given emotions, we can modify the likelihood of specific tokens appearing in the model’s answer using the API’s logit_bias parameter. As per the API reference, we can map token IDs to bias values ranging from -100 to 100 (where -100 results in the ban of a given token and 100 leads to its exclusive selection). The bias values will be added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling.\nLet’s create a dictionary of biases for our purpose. We’ll use OpenAI’s tiktoken package to encode the emotions in our list. Since tiktoken is a subword tokenizer, one emotion can map to multiple token IDs:\n\n\nCode\nencoder = tiktoken.encoding_for_model(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n\nfor emotion in [\"joy\", \"love\", \"fear\", \"anger\", \"sadness\", \"surprise\"]:\n    print(f\"{emotion}: {encoder.encode(emotion)}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nend token: {encoder.encode('.')}\")\n\n\njoy: [4215]\nlove: [31153]\nfear: [69, 686]\nanger: [4091]\nsadness: [83214, 2136]\nsurprise: [20370, 9868]\n\nend token: [13]\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef create_biases(tokens, bias_value):\n    biases = {}\n    for token in tokens:\n        token_ids = encoder.encode(token)\n        for token_id in token_ids:\n            biases[token_id] = bias_value\n    return biases\n\n\nLet’s try a bias value of 10 for each token ID. To ensure that the model always picks the token with the highest logit, we’ll set the temperature to 0.0.\nFinally, we can use the max_tokens parameter as well as the stop parameter to further constrain the model:\n\nWe set max_tokens to 3 meaning that ChatGPT will never reply with more tokens.\nWe set stop to \".\" so that the model never generates any more tokens after replying with \".\".\n\nSince we want to do few-shot sentiment analysis, we’ll provide five examples per category to the model. To do this, we’ll provide the tweet using the user role and the correct answer using the assistant role that is available in the API.\n\n\nCode\ntrain_examples = df.groupby(\"label_str\")[[\"text\", \"label_str\"]].sample(5, random_state=1).reset_index(drop=True)\ntrain_examples = train_examples.iloc[rng.permuted(np.arange(train_examples.shape[0]))]\ntrain_examples = dict(zip(train_examples.text, train_examples.label_str))\n\nfewshot = []\nfor tweet, emotion in train_examples.items():\n    fewshot.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": tweet})\n    fewshot.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": emotion + \".\"})\nfewshot[:4]\n\n\n[{'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'i always feel awkward when im alone in a crowd of peers and feel the need to make friends'},\n {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sadness.'},\n {'role': 'user',\n  'content': 'i have a feeling i took so much time but kuya buddy and kuya angee have been very supportive all the way'},\n {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'love.'}]\n\n\nFinally, we’ll wrap the entire thing in a simple function:\n\n\nCode\ndef get_sentiment(example, system_prompt, fewshot_examples, emotions, end_token, bias_value=10):\n    biases = create_biases(emotions + [end_token], bias_value)\n    completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n            *fewshot_examples,\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": example}\n        ],\n        temperature=0.0,\n        max_tokens=3,\n        stop=end_token,\n        logit_bias=biases\n    )\n    sentiment = completion[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"][\"content\"]\n    return sentiment\n\n\nNow let’s try this for the first tweet in the category “joy” that we’ve seen earlier:\n\n\nCode\nget_sentiment(example=\"i have been with petronas for years i feel that petronas has performed well and made a huge profit\",\n              system_prompt=system_prompt,\n              fewshot_examples=fewshot,\n              emotions=list(df[\"label_str\"].unique()),\n              end_token=\".\")\n\n\n'joy'\n\n\nThis actually works! But how well? To find out we’ll use a random subset of 100 rows from the dataset’s predefined test set:\n\n\nCode\ntest_df = ds[\"test\"][:]\ntest_df[\"label_str\"] = test_df[\"label\"].map(label_int2str)\ntest_df = test_df.sample(n=100, random_state=1)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nget_chatgpt_pred = partial(get_sentiment, system_prompt=system_prompt, fewshot_examples=fewshot, emotions=list(df[\"label_str\"].unique()), end_token=\".\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntest_df[\"chatgpt_pred_str\"] = test_df[\"text\"].apply(get_chatgpt_pred)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntest_df.head(20)\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\ntext\nlabel\nlabel_str\nchatgpt_pred_str\n\n\n\n\n674\ni want to feel assured that my life will be go...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n1699\ni hear someone say we should just let gardener...\n3\nanger\nanger\n\n\n1282\nim always feeling so agitated overly excited a...\n3\nanger\nanger\n\n\n1315\ni guess it comes from believing that when i wa...\n1\njoy\nsadness\n\n\n1210\ni feel like this beats out just about any popu...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n1636\ni feel like we re getting a terrific recruiter...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n613\ni feel curious because i would like to explore...\n5\nsurprise\nsurprise\n\n\n447\ni did not know this i could not look out upon ...\n0\nsadness\nsadness\n\n\n1131\ni feel terrible when i hurt peoples feelings w...\n0\nsadness\nsadness\n\n\n808\ni can t say for certain why but it actually ma...\n1\njoy\nsurprise\n\n\n1496\ni feel they are frightened of fats\n4\nfear\nanger\n\n\n1468\nim feeling optimistic to finish out these last...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n1682\ni think im making up for feeling like i missed...\n0\nsadness\njoy\n\n\n1149\ni feel so greedy so needy so helpless\n3\nanger\nsadness\n\n\n442\ni had to continue to enforce my no playdate po...\n3\nanger\nanger\n\n\n1813\nim feeling exponentially more useless on the f...\n0\nsadness\nsadness\n\n\n654\ni met my present boyfriend on a boat trip to e...\n1\njoy\nlove\n\n\n1264\ni feel it is acceptable as this is not everyda...\n1\njoy\njoy\n\n\n858\ni feel like i just doomed myself\n0\nsadness\nfear\n\n\n1482\ni feel that they ignored the systemic nature o...\n0\nsadness\nanger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n        \n  \n    \n    \n  \n      \n      \n  \n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n\n\nAs we can see in the confusion matrix, the results are mixed. Given the few-shot setting and the sometimes debatable labels, ChatGPT probably still performed quite well. After all, it can be quite hard to draw a distinction between classes like joy and love or anger and fear. Nonetheless, finetuning a dedicated model for this task (e.g., a small model of the DeBERTa family) would have yielded much better results.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))\ncm = confusion_matrix(test_df.chatgpt_pred_str.map(label_str2int), test_df.label_str.map(label_str2int), normalize=\"true\")\ndisp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=label_int2str.values())\ndisp.plot(cmap=\"YlGn\", values_format=\".2f\", ax=ax, colorbar=False);"

    "text": "Setup\n\nMixed precision\nOn GPUs with Tensor Cores (i.e., GPUs with compute capability of at least 7.0) training with mixed precision can provide significant speedups. Mixed precision translates to running operations in float16 if possible while keeping variables and some computations in float32 for numeric reasons. This speeds up reading from memory as well as run times, and often allows to double the batch size.\nTo use mixed precision in Keras, we need to set a global policy:\n\n\nCode\ntf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy(\"mixed_float16\")\n\n\nImportant:\n\nIn order to guarantee numeric stability, the outputs of our model’s last layer have to be in float32. Since each Keras layer uses the global policy by default, we have to specify the corresponding dtype explicitly.\nTensor Cores require most tensor dimensions to be a multiple of 8. See Nvidia’s performance guide for details.\nIf we implement a custom training loop (i.e., if we don’t use tf.keras.Model.fit()), we have to prevent our gradients from underflowing to zero by using loss scaling. See this guide for more.\nOn CPUs float16 operations are slower than float32 operations. Thus, input processing on the CPU should generally be in float32.\n\n\n\nDistribution Strategy\nTensorFlow offers the tf.distribute.Strategy API to easily scale model training onto multiple GPUs, multiple machines, or TPUs. The following three strategies are the most common:\n\ntf.distribute.MirroredStrategy: Use this strategy when using a single machine with one or more GPUs. Replicates the model graph and all variables on each available GPU and distributes the input evenly across all replicas. Each replica calculates the gradients for its input; the gradients are synced across all replicas by summing them so that the same update is made on all replicas.\ntf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy: Extends the MirroredStrategy to a multi-machine setup. Requires setting up the TF_CONFIG environment variable correctly.\ntf.distribute.TPUStrategy: The strategy when using Google’s TPUs.\n\nHere we’ll use tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy since we want to train on two GPUs. For more on distributed training with TensorFlow, see the corresponding guide.\n\n\nCode\nstrategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()\nprint(\"# replicas:\", strategy.num_replicas_in_sync)\n\n\n# replicas: 2\n\n\n\n\nAutotune\nWhen using TensorFlow’s tf.data API, we can use AUTOTUNE to automatically optimize the allocation of the CPU budget to speed up the input pipeline. We’ll see soon how this plays out.\n\n\nCode\nAUTO = tf.data.AUTOTUNE"

TFRecord is an efficient format for storing a sequence of binary records allowing very fast I/O operations. To easily stream the contents of one or more TFRecord files, we can use the tf.data API (more specifically, the tf.data.TFRecordDataset class; we just need to pass in a list of filenames).\n\n\nCode\nraw_paths = tf.io.gfile.glob(DATA_DIR + \"/train/*.tfrec\")\nraw_dataset = tf.data.TFRecordDataset(raw_paths)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfor example in raw_dataset.take(3):\n    print(repr(example)[:300])\n\n\n&lt;tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'\\n\\xa3\\xb6\\x02\\n\\x13\\n\\x02id\\x12\\r\\n\\x0b\\n\\t05fa7d4ca\\n\\x0e\\n\\x05class\\x12\\x05\\x1a\\x03\\n\\x01f\\n\\xfa\\xb5\\x02\\n\\x05image\\x12\\xef\\xb5\\x02\\n\\xeb\\xb5\\x02\\n\\xe7\\xb5\\x02\\xff\\xd8\\xff\\xe0\\x00\\x10JFIF\\x00\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01,\\x01,\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xdb\\x00C\\x00\\x02\\x01\\x01\\x0\n&lt;tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'\\n\\xaf\\xde\\x03\\n\\x13\\n\\x02id\\x12\\r\\n\\x0b\\n\\tbafaca028\\n\\x0e\\n\\x05class\\x12\\x05\\x1a\\x03\\n\\x01\\x08\\n\\x86\\xde\\x03\\n\\x05image\\x12\\xfb\\xdd\\x03\\n\\xf7\\xdd\\x03\\n\\xf3\\xdd\\x03\\xff\\xd8\\xff\\xe0\\x00\\x10JFIF\\x00\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01,\\x01,\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xdb\\x00C\\x00\\x02\\x01\\x01\n&lt;tf.Tensor: shape=(), dtype=string, numpy=b'\\n\\xee\\xc5\\x03\\n\\x0e\\n\\x05class\\x12\\x05\\x1a\\x03\\n\\x01\\x0e\\n\\xc5\\xc5\\x03\\n\\x05image\\x12\\xba\\xc5\\x03\\n\\xb6\\xc5\\x03\\n\\xb2\\xc5\\x03\\xff\\xd8\\xff\\xe0\\x00\\x10JFIF\\x00\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01,\\x01,\\x00\\x00\\xff\\xdb\\x00C\\x00\\x02\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x02\\x01\\x01\\x01\\x02\\x02\\x0\n\n\nAs we can see, we’ll have to decode the examples. For this purpose, we can use the following function that takes in a raw example and returns the image and its class label. Since we’ll use MixUp later, we need to return the one-hot encoded class labels. Also, we ignore the id feature since we won’t need it.\n\n\nCode\ndef parse_tfrecord(example):\n    features = {\n        \"image\": tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),\n        \"class\": tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.int64),\n        \"id\": tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),\n    }\n    example = tf.io.parse_single_example(example, features)\n    image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(example['image'], channels=3)\n    image = tf.reshape(image, [*IMAGE_SIZE, 3])\n    label = tf.one_hot(tf.cast(example['class'], tf.int32), len(CLASSES))\n    return image, label\n\n\nNow we can read in the entire dataset using the function below. To benefit from parallelization (if possible), we can set num_parallel_reads=AUTO. For more on defining and reading TFRecords, see here.\n\n\nCode\ndef load_dataset(filenames):    \n    dataset = (\n        tf.data.TFRecordDataset(filenames, num_parallel_reads=AUTO)\n        .map(parse_tfrecord, num_parallel_calls=AUTO)\n    )\n    \n    return dataset\n\n\n\n\nCreating training and validation splits\nWhile stratified k-fold cross-validation (CV) would certainly be the best way to evaluate our training procedure, we’ll opt for a basic train-validation split to avoid unnecessary energy consumption and keep things simple. Also, the dataset already comes with predefined folders containing the images for training, validation and testing, respectively. To load the images, we simply gather the corresponding filenames.\n\n\nCode\nTRAIN_FILENAMES = tf.io.gfile.glob(DATA_DIR + '/train/*.tfrec')\nVALID_FILENAMES = tf.io.gfile.glob(DATA_DIR + '/val/*.tfrec')\n\ndef count_data_items(filenames):\n    # the name of the .tfrec files contains the number of images in the corresponding file\n    # 00-224x224-462.tfrec = 462 examples\n    n = [int(re.compile(r\"-([0-9]*)\\.\").search(filename).group(1)) for filename in filenames]\n    return np.sum(n)\n\nnum_training_images = count_data_items(TRAIN_FILENAMES)\nnum_validation_images = count_data_items(VALID_FILENAMES)\nprint(\"Training images:\", num_training_images)\nprint(\"Validation images:\", num_validation_images)\n\n\nTraining images: 12753\nValidation images: 3712\n\n\n\n\nData augmentation\nFor data augmentation, we begin by defining some basic transformations using tf.image methods. Note that we could also do this in Keras layers. To show that we can use Keras layers for preprocessing, we’ll add a RandomCrop layer at the beginning of our model (we could have done this in the data augmentation function too).\n\n\nCode\ndef augment_data(image, label):\n    image = tf.image.random_flip_left_right(image)\n    image = tf.image.random_brightness(image, 0.2)\n    image = tf.image.random_contrast(image, 0.5, 2.)\n    image = tf.image.random_saturation(image, 0.8, 1.2)\n    return image, label\n\n\nWe also implement the MixUp augmentation technique.\n\n\nCode\nMIXUP_FRAC = 0.4\n\ndef mixup(img, label):\n    def _interpolate(b1, b2, t):\n        return t*b1 + (1-t)*b2\n\n    n = np.rint(MIXUP_FRAC * len(img)).astype(np.int32)\n    t = np.round(np.random.uniform(0.5, 0.8), 2)\n    \n    img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, tf.float32)\n    \n    img1, label1 = img[:n], label[:n]\n    img2, label2 = img[1:n+1], label[1:n+1]\n    interp_img = _interpolate(img1, img2, t)\n    interp_label = _interpolate(label1, label2, t)\n       \n    img = tf.concat([interp_img, img[n:]], axis=0)\n    label = tf.concat([interp_label, label[n:]], axis=0)\n    \n    img = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(img, tf.uint8)\n    \n    return img, label\n\n\n\n\nLoading the training and validation data\nNow we are ready to define the functions for loading the training and validation data. We begin with get_training_dataset():\n\n\nCode\ndef get_training_dataset():\n    dataset = load_dataset(TRAIN_FILENAMES)\n    dataset = (\n        dataset.map(augment_data, num_parallel_calls=AUTO)\n               .repeat()\n               .shuffle(BATCH_SIZE * 8)\n               .batch(BATCH_SIZE, drop_remainder=True)\n               .map(mixup)\n               .prefetch(AUTO)\n    )\n    return dataset\n\n\nLet’s go through the method calls:\n\nmap(augment_data): We start with applying the augmentations defined in the augment_data function.\nrepeat(): In practice, we often want to train for a fixed number of training examples instead of a fixed number of epochs. We call repeat() to avoid problems when we overestimate the size of our training dataset. If we underestimate the number of training examples, the remaining examples simply carry over to the next epoch. Note that computing the required number of steps for a (virtual) epoch is easy: steps_per_epoch = num_training_examples // batch_size.\nshuffle(): In general, we want batches that contain different training examples (as opposed to batches with many similar examples, e.g., only images of roses). Thus, we randomize the examples by shuffling within a buffer that is (much) larger than the batch size. The size of the buffer should depend on how ordered the dataset is. (If the dataset is sorted by label, the buffer size has to cover the entire dataset. In that case, we should already shuffle the data when preparing the training dataset.)\nbatch(): Creates the batches of our desired batch size.

    "section": "Finetuning",
    "text": "Finetuning\n\nDefining the model\nWhen it comes to choosing a pretrained model, there are a lot of great options. Here, we’ll just use a model from the EfficientNet family that is available in tf.keras.applications (if a model is not yet available within Keras, it can usually be downloaded from the TensorFlow Hub). In particular, we’ll use a pretrained EfficientNetB3 which takes input images of shape (300, 300, 3). See here for the original paper and here for some practical information regarding finetuning EfficientNets.\nA few notes:\n\nWe want to obtain a 3D feature map from the pretrained model that we can combine with a custom classification head. Thus, we set include_top=False.\nSince we want to finetune the model (as opposed to transfer learning), we have to set the trainable flag to True.\nTo apply the appropriate preprocessing for the model (e.g., converting the pixel values to a specific range like [0,1] or [-1, 1]), we use a Lambda layer that wraps the preprocess_input function that comes with the model.\n\nThe layers that follow the pretrained model are simple:\n\nGlobalAveragePooling2D averages the values in each channel of the final feature map. Note that this averaging procedure removes positional information that is present in the channels (in classification tasks this usually doesn’t matter; however, it is generally not a good choice in tasks like object detection).\nWe include a Dropout layer to reduce overfitting.\nAs usual, the final Dense layer, combined with the softmax activation, allows us to obtain the class probabilities.\n\nTo apply the distribution strategy discussed earlier, we have to define the model within a corresponding context manager (with strategy.scope():).\n\n\nCode\nwith strategy.scope():\n    pretrained_model = tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB3(weights=\"imagenet\", include_top=False, input_shape=[300, 300, 3])\n    pretrained_model.trainable = True\n    \n    model = tf.keras.Sequential([\n        tf.keras.layers.InputLayer((331, 331, 3)),\n        tf.keras.layers.RandomCrop(height=300, width=300),\n        tf.keras.layers.Lambda(lambda data: tf.keras.applications.efficientnet.preprocess_input(tf.cast(data, tf.float32)), input_shape=[300, 300, 3]),\n        pretrained_model,\n        tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),\n        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),\n        tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(CLASSES), name=\"last_dense\"),\n        tf.keras.layers.Activation(\"softmax\", dtype=\"float32\", name=\"predictions\")\n    ])\n    \nmodel.compile(\n    optimizer='adam',\n    loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',\n    metrics=['accuracy'],\n)\nmodel.summary()\n\n\nDownloading data from https://storage.googleapis.com/keras-applications/efficientnetb3_notop.h5\n43941888/43941136 [==============================] - 0s 0us/step\n43950080/43941136 [==============================] - 0s 0us/step\nModel: \"sequential\"\n_________________________________________________________________\nLayer (type)                 Output Shape              Param #   \n=================================================================\nrandom_crop (RandomCrop)     (None, 300, 300, 3)       0         \n_________________________________________________________________\nlambda (Lambda)              (None, 300, 300, 3)       0         \n_________________________________________________________________\nefficientnetb3 (Functional)  (None, 10, 10, 1536)      10783535  \n_________________________________________________________________\nglobal_average_pooling2d (Gl (None, 1536)              0         \n_________________________________________________________________\ndropout (Dropout)            (None, 1536)              0         \n_________________________________________________________________\nlast_dense (Dense)           (None, 104)               159848    \n_________________________________________________________________\npredictions (Activation)     (None, 104)               0         \n=================================================================\nTotal params: 10,943,383\nTrainable params: 10,856,080\nNon-trainable params: 87,303\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\nLearning rate schedule\nIt can be tricky to find a learning rate that works well in a finetuning task. Let’s try the following learning schedule that combines warm-up period and an exponential decay. The implementation below is an example:\n\n\nCode\nEPOCHS = 13\n\nstart_lr = 0.0001\nmin_lr = 0.0001\nmax_lr = 0.0002 * strategy.num_replicas_in_sync\nrampup_epochs = 3\nsustain_epochs = 0\nexp_decay = 0.75\n\ndef lrfn(epoch):\n    if epoch &lt; rampup_epochs:\n        return (max_lr - start_lr)/rampup_epochs * epoch + start_lr\n    elif epoch &lt; rampup_epochs + sustain_epochs:\n        return max_lr\n    else:\n        return (max_lr - min_lr) * exp_decay**(epoch-rampup_epochs-sustain_epochs) + min_lr\n    \nlr_callback = tf.keras.callbacks.LearningRateScheduler(lambda epoch: lrfn(epoch), verbose=True)\n\nrang = np.arange(EPOCHS)\ny = [lrfn(x) for x in rang]\nplt.plot(rang, y);\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother option that can work very well is using differential learning rates (i.e., different learning rates for different layers of the model). Intuitively, we’ll want low learning rates for the pretrained layers and a normal learning rate for the layers of our custom classification head. Note that differential learning rates can be combined with a learning rate scheduler.\n\n\nFitting the model\n\n\nCode\nSTEPS_PER_EPOCH = num_training_images // BATCH_SIZE\nVALIDATION_STEPS = -(-num_validation_images // BATCH_SIZE)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhistory = model.fit(train_dataset, \n                    steps_per_epoch=STEPS_PER_EPOCH, \n                    epochs=EPOCHS,\n

Note that we’ll use the T-Systems-onsite/cross-en-de-roberta-sentence-transformer model checkpoint (see here for the model card) that was fine-tuned on English and German text and is intended for computing text embeddings.\n\n\nCode\nmodel_ckpt = \"T-Systems-onsite/cross-en-de-roberta-sentence-transformer\"\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_ckpt)\nmodel = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_ckpt)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nencoded = tokenizer(speeches.iloc[0].speechContent, padding=True, truncation=True)\ntokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(encoded.input_ids)\nprint(tokens[:100])\nprint(len(tokens))\n\n\n['&lt;s&gt;', '▁Gut', 'en', '▁Morgen', ',', '▁liebe', '▁Kolle', 'ginn', 'en', '▁und', '▁Kollegen', '!', '▁Nehmen', '▁Sie', '▁bitte', '▁Platz', '.', '▁Meine', '▁sehr', '▁ver', 'ehrt', 'en', '▁Damen', '▁und', '▁Herren', '!', '▁Liebe', '▁Kolle', 'ginn', 'en', '▁und', '▁Kollegen', '!', '▁Ich', '▁be', 'gr', 'üß', 'e', '▁Sie', '▁zur', '▁konstitu', 'ierenden', '▁Sitzung', '▁des', '▁19.', '▁Deutschen', '▁Bundestag', 'es', '.', '▁Es', '▁entspricht', '▁der', '▁ständig', 'en', '▁Übung', ',', '▁zu', '▁Beginn', '▁der', '▁konstitu', 'ierenden', '▁Sitzung', '▁nach', '▁den', '▁Regelung', 'en', '▁der', '▁bisherige', 'n', '▁Geschäfts', 'ordnung', '▁des', '▁Deutschen', '▁Bundestag', 'es', '▁zu', '▁', 'verfahren', '.', '▁§', '▁1', '▁Absatz', '▁2', '▁der', '▁Geschäfts', 'ordnung', '▁des', '▁Deutschen', '▁Bundestag', 'es', '▁sieht', '▁vor', ',', '▁dass', '▁das', '▁am', '▁längst', 'en', '▁dem', '▁Bundestag']\n436\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntokenizer.model_max_length\n\n\n512\n\n\nThe tokenizer splits our example into 436 tokens which is less than the model’s maximum context size of 512. Note that we’ll simply truncate the input sequence if it is longer (we could certainly use a more sophisticated approach using windows, but let’s keep it simple here).\n\n\nCode\ndecoded = tokenizer.decode(encoded.input_ids)\ndecoded[:1000]\n\n\n'&lt;s&gt; Guten Morgen, liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Nehmen Sie bitte Platz. Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Ich begrüße Sie zur konstituierenden Sitzung des 19. Deutschen Bundestages. Es entspricht der ständigen Übung, zu Beginn der konstituierenden Sitzung nach den Regelungen der bisherigen Geschäftsordnung des Deutschen Bundestages zu verfahren. § 1 Absatz 2 der Geschäftsordnung des Deutschen Bundestages sieht vor, dass das am längsten dem Bundestag angehörende Mitglied, das hierzu bereit ist, den Vorsitz übernimmt, bis der Deutsche Bundestag einen Präsidenten gewählt hat. Die Fraktion der AfD widerspricht diesem Verfahren und hat auf Drucksache 19/2 beantragt, einen Versammlungsleiter zu wählen, der die konstituierende Sitzung eröffnen soll. Über diesen Antrag lasse ich sofort abstimmen. Wer dem Antrag der Fraktion der AfD zustimmt, den bitte ich um sein Handzeichen. – Gegenstimmen? – ({0}) Enthaltungen? – Der Antrag ist damit mit den Stimmen all'\n\n\nAs we can see, the tokenizer removes some of the issues we’ve seen earlier in its preprocessing stage.\nWe can now apply the model and have a look at its outputs:\n\n\nCode\nencoded = tokenizer(speeches.iloc[0].speechContent, \n                    padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    model_output = model(**encoded)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_output[\"last_hidden_state\"].shape, len(tokens)\n\n\n(torch.Size([1, 436, 768]), 436)\n\n\nAs expected, we get an embedding vector of size 768 for every token in our input (including the special tokens &lt;s&gt; and '&lt;/s&gt;' at the beginning and at the end). To get our final embedding for the whole input, we’ll have to apply mean pooling to the model’s output (i.e., we average the embeddings for all tokens to get the final embedding). Thus, we have to define a corresponding function:\n\n\nCode\ndef mean_pooling(model_output, attention_mask):\n    token_embeddings = model_output[0]\n    input_mask_expanded = attention_mask.unsqueeze(-1).expand(token_embeddings.size()).float()\n    return torch.sum(token_embeddings * input_mask_expanded, 1) / torch.clamp(input_mask_expanded.sum(1), min=1e-9)\n\n\nWith this function, we can finally compute the embedding:\n\n\nCode\nspeech_embedding = mean_pooling(model_output, encoded[\"attention_mask\"])\nspeech_embedding.shape\n\n\ntorch.Size([1, 768])\n\n\nSo far, so good. We can achieve the very same, though, using the Sentence-Transformers library which is dedicated to computing embeddings.\nTo load our model, we now use the SentenceTransformer class. To obtain the embedding, we simply call model.encode().\n\n\nCode\nmodel = SentenceTransformer(model_ckpt)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nspeech_embedding_st = model.encode(speeches.iloc[0].speechContent)\nspeech_embedding_st.shape\n\n\n\n\n\n(768,)\n\n\nThis way we actually get the same embedding as we did when using the HuggingFace transformer library.\nNow we can compute embeddings for all samples in our dataset. What would have lasted many hours on a CPU gets processed in batches in a few minutes on a GPU; just set batched=True when calling map(). Note that we could have also set the batch_size parameter (we use the default batch size of 1000).\n\n\nCode\nembeddings_dataset = dataset.map(\n    lambda batch: {\"embeddings\": model.encode(batch[\"speechContent\"])}, batched=True\n)\n\n\nNow that we added the embeddings to our dataset, we can make use of the FAISS library (FAISS is short for Facebook AI Similarity Search) which provides efficient algorithms for searching and clustering embedding vectors. Computing a FAISS index for a HuggingFace Dataset is easy:\n\n\nCode\nembeddings_dataset.add_faiss_index(column=\"embeddings\")\n\n\n\n\n\nDataset({\n    features: ['id', 'session', 'firstName', 'lastName', 'speechContent', 'position', 'date', 'faction', 'embeddings'],\n    num_rows: 60958\n})"

    "text": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is the task of learning how to behave in an uncertain environment by interacting with it in order to achieve a goal. In that sense, RL closely resembles the way humans learn: while supervised learning means learning from labeled examples and unsupervised learning is concerned with finding patterns in unlabeled data, RL is tasked with solving sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.\nIn RL, the learning algorithm is called agent and interacts over a sequence of discrete time steps with an environment that may be incompletely controllable as well as incompletely known. At each time step, the agent receives a representation of the environment’s state which he uses to select an action. In the following time step, the environment has reached a new state and the agent gets a numerical reward signal to help him evaluate his choice of action. The agent’s goal is to maximize the cumulative reward received by developing an optimal policy, i.e. an optimal strategy for selecting actions depending on the state of the environment. This continued interaction can be formalized by a mathematical framework called Markov decision process (MDP) that serves as the theoretical foundation of RL algorithms. Its components are introduced below."

    "section": "Terminology",
    "text": "Terminology\n\nAgent\nAn agent is a decision maker in an environment. It can sense at least parts of that environment and it can choose actions to influence that environment. Its goal is to maximize cumulative rewards by finding the optimal strategy to navigate the environment. Thus, an agent can be seen as following a process with three steps:\n\nInteraction with the environment (by observing its state and choosing an action)\nEvaluation of the current behavior\nImprovement of the behavior to fare better in the future\n\nIn practice, the decision-making algorithm serves as the agent.\n\n\nEnvironment\nThe environment bundles together everything outside of the agent and embodies the problem or task that the agent faces. Therefore, it is crucial to think about the boundary between agents and the environment. Agents are decision makers only. Everything an agent has no absolute control over (i.e. cannot change arbitrarily) belongs to its environment. For example, even the sensors, motors, arms, etc. of a robot are typically considered to be part of the environment. The agent in this case is only the algorithm that controls the robot. This does not mean that everything in the environment is unknown to the agent, however. The agent can observe at least parts of the environment and may even know exactly which rules govern the environment’s dynamics.\n\n\nState and Observation\nAn environment can be represented by a set of variables called the state. The state space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (itself a set) defines which values those variables can possibly take. A state \\(s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\) is simply an instantiation of the state space, i.e. a unique configuration of the environment at a particular point in time. While \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) can be finite or infinite, the set of variables that compose a single state \\(s\\) has to be finite and of equal size for every state. The state of the environment at time step \\(t\\) is denoted \\(S_t\\).\nIn the MDP framework, we assume that the states 1) are fully observable, i.e. fully capture the internals of the environment, and 2) contain all variables required to make them independent of all other states, i.e. they are a self-contained representation of the problem. If an agent – in violation of that assumption – can only partially observe the environment, the information available to the agent is called an observation \\(o\\). The set of all possible values an observation can take is then called the observation space \\(\\mathcal{O}\\). This is a more general (and more realistic) framing of the problem that can be seen as an extension of the MDP framework. It is referred to as POMDP (Partially Observable Markov Decision Process). It should be noted, though, that both terms (state and observation) are often used interchangeably despite their slightly different meanings.\n\n\nAction\nAt every time step, an agent can either deterministically or stochastically select an action \\(a\\) to influence the environment. The set of all possible actions is called the action space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) and can be finite or infinite. It is possible that not every action is available in every state and that an action doesn’t affect the environment at all (i.e., a no-op action, meaning that the environment stays in the same state). The action selected at time step \\(t\\) is denoted \\(A_t\\).\n\n\nTransition function\nIn response to the action of an agent the environment may change its state (“may” because it can also stay in the same state). The transition to a new state \\(s'\\) depends on the old state \\(s\\) and an action \\(a\\) and is either deterministically or stochastically defined by the state-transition function \\(p(s' \\vert s, a)\\) which outputs the probability of the transition from state \\(s\\) to \\(s'\\) when taking action \\(a\\).\n\\[p(s' \\vert s, a) = P(S_t = s' \\vert S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1}=a)\\]\n\\[\\sum_{s' \\in\\ \\mathcal{S}} p(s' \\vert s, a) = 1, \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}, \\forall a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)\\]\nMany RL algorithms assume that the probability distribution of transitions does not change over time. However, this stationarity assumption has to be relaxed in many situations.\n\n\nReward function\nThe environment responds to an interaction with an agent by providing a numerical reward which signals the goodness of the transition. Rewards can be negative, in which case they can be interpreted as cost or penalty. Since it is the objective of an agent to maximize cumulative rewards, the reward function defines the goal of an RL task. Hence, the design of the reward scheme is critical when constructing an RL problem. While a sparse reward signal offers less supervision and thus a higher chance of novel, unexpected behavior, a more dense signal usually allows the agent to learn faster, but also injects bias. Usually, the injection of prior knowledge is not something we want: the reward function should only tell the agent what he should achieve and not how he should achieve it. However, adding a time step cost is a common practice.\nThe reward function is typically defined as a function that takes the full transition tuple \\(s,a,s'\\) and outputs the expected reward (“expected” since reward signals may be stochastic): \\[r(s,a,s') = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ R_t\\ \\vert\\ S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a, S_t = s' \\right]\\]\nNote that the reward signal received at time step \\(t\\), \\(R_t\\), not only depends on the state and the action in the last time step \\(t{-}1\\), but also on the next state \\(S_t\\). This makes sense: for example, success in a game of tennis not only depends on the state of the game and your shot selection (the action) in the last time step, but also (and rather importantly) on the outcome of your shot (the next state).\nAlso note that computing the marginalization over next states gives \\(r(s,a)\\)… \\[r(s,a) = \\mathbb{E} \\left[R_t \\vert S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1} = a \\right]\\]\n…and further marginalization over actions gives \\(r(s)\\): \\[r(s) = \\mathbb{E} \\left[R_t \\vert S_{t-1} = s \\right]\\]\n\n\nDynamics of the MDP\nHaving introduced states, actions, and rewards, we can now look at the function \\(p(s',r \\vert s, a)\\) which completely defines the dynamics of an MDP:\n\\[p(s',r \\vert s, a) = P(S_t = s', R_t = r\\ \\vert\\ S_{t-1} = s, A_{t-1}=a)\\]\n\\[\\sum_{s' \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s',r \\vert s,a) = 1, \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}, \\forall a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)\\]\nThe formula shows that in an MDP the probability of each possible value for \\(S_t\\) and \\(R_t\\) depends only on the state and action in the last time step. That is, the probability of transitioning from state \\(s\\) to \\(s'\\) given action \\(a\\) has to be the same regardless of all states and actions encountered before. Put simply, the future and the past are conditionally independent given the present because the present state encapsulates all necessary information. This is called the Markov property.\nNote that we can quite easily compute the state-transition function \\(p(s' \\vert s, a)\\) as well as the reward function \\(r(s,a,s')\\) from the dynamics function \\(p(s', r \\vert s, a)\\):\n\\[p(s' \\vert s, a) = \\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} p(s', r \\vert s, a)\\]\n\\[r(s,a,s') = \\sum_{r \\in \\mathcal{R}} r \\dfrac{p(s',r \\vert s, a)}{p(s' \\vert s, a)}\\]\nIf an agent has a perfect model of the environment’s dynamics, we can, in theory (i.e. disregarding practical issues of computational power and memory), find the optimal solution of an RL task. If there is only incomplete information available we have to approximate the optimal solution.\n\n\nEpisodic vs. Continuing Tasks\nIn RL, we distinguish between episodic and continuing tasks. Episodic tasks have a natural ending, that is, they end in a terminal state after which the environment can be reset and the agent has to start from the beginning. A terminal state is a special state that transitions only to itself while providing no reward. To handle episodic tasks, we need to introduce some new notation: while the set of all nonterminal states is denoted \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), the set of all states including terminal states is typically denoted \\(\\mathcal{S}^+\\). The time step when an episode terminates is denoted \\(T\\) and usually varies from episode to episode.\nWhen the interaction of agent and environment does not break naturally into subsequences but goes on continually without an end, the task is continuing. Examples might be the control of an on-going process or the trading of stocks. In continuing tasks \\(T=\\infty\\), although in many cases a time step limit is set which results in an episodic task.\n\n\nReturn\nThe idea of cumulative reward is formalized by the return which is defined as the function of future rewards that an agent sets out to maximize in expectation. While rewards only relay an immediate sense of goodness, returns indicate the performance in the long run. In the simplest case the return is just the sum of the reward sequence in an episode:\n\\[G_t = R_{t+1} + R_{t+2} +  \\dots + R_T\\]\nHowever, there are several reasons why we would like to discount the value of rewards over time, especially in continuing tasks with infinite reward sequences:\n\nReducing the variance of the reward sequence (since future rewards have higher uncertainty, just think about the stock market)\nFocusing on more immediate rewards (since rewards we get sooner may be more attractive than rewards we get later)\nMathematical and computational convenience (since we don’t need to track the far future)\n\nThus, the standard formula for the return looks like this: \\[G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma R_{t+2} + \\gamma^2 R_{t+3} + \\dots\\ = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\\]\nThe parameter \\(\\gamma\\), \\(0 \\leq \\gamma \\leq 1\\), is called the discount rate and defines how we value future rewards. A reward of \\(+1\\) received in \\(k\\) time steps is worth only \\(\\gamma^{k-1}\\) in the present. This means that an agent maximizes only immediate rewards if \\(\\gamma=0\\) (the agent is called “myopic” in this case), and becomes more farsighted as \\(\\gamma\\) approaches \\(1\\).\nFinally, note that the return can be defined recursively: \\[G_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1}\\]\n\n\nPolicy function\nA policy, denoted \\(\\pi\\), is the behavior function of an agent: it maps states of the environment to actions to be taken in those states and is thus the key feature of an agent.\nIn the deterministic case, a policy just maps a state to an action: \\[\\pi(s)=a\\]\nMore common is the stochastic case, though. Here, the policy defines a probability distribution over all available actions for every state: \\[\\pi(a\\ \\vert\\ s) = P_{\\pi}(A=a\\ \\vert\\ S=s)\\]\nA policy \\(\\pi\\) is defined to be better than or equal to another policy \\(\\pi'\\) if its expected return is greater than or equal to that of \\(\\pi'\\) for all states. There is always at least one optimal policy \\(\\pi_*\\) which is better than or equal to all other policies. Consequently, we want to design an agent that generates (or at least approximates) an optimal policy.\n\n\nState-value function\nValues form the core of RL. While a reward solely relays an immediate notion of goodness, a value signals what is good in the long run. The value of a state is defined as the return an agent can expect to get if he starts in that state and follows policy \\(\\pi\\). Formally, the state-value function \\(v_{\\pi}\\) is defined as: \\[v_{\\pi} = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ G_t \\vert S_t = S \\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\\ \\middle|\\ S_t = s \\right]\\ \\ \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\]\nEvidently, agents shouldn’t seek to reach states that merely offer high rewards; instead they should go for states with high values (because those states are regularly followed by states with high rewards and thus yield high expected returns). In other words, state-values indicate the long-term desirability of states.\nInterestingly (and importantly), \\(v_{\\pi}\\) can be expressed recursively:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nv_{\\pi} & = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ G_t \\vert S_t = S \\right]\\\\\n        & = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1} \\vert S_t = S \\right]\\\\\n        & = \\sum_{a} \\pi(a \\vert s) \\sum_{s'} \\sum_{r} p(s',r \\vert s, a) \\left[ r + \\gamma \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} [ G_{t+1} \\vert S_{t+1} = s' ] \\right]\\\\\n        & = \\sum_{a} \\color{orange}{\\pi (a \\vert s)} \\color{black}{\\sum_{s', r}} \\color{purple}{p(s', r \\vert s, a)} \\color{blue}{\\left[r + \\gamma v_{\\pi}(s') \\right]} \\color{black}{,\\ \\forall\\ s \\in \\mathcal{S}}\n\\end{align}\\]\nEquation (4) is called the Bellman equation. It is based on the recursive relationship between the value of a state and the value of its possible successor states. Let’s go over the math in detail. The Bellman equation is a sum over all possibilities of the action \\(a\\), the next state \\(s'\\), and the reward \\(r\\). For each triple \\((a,s',r)\\), we calculate the value by summing the reward \\(\\color{blue}{r}\\) and the discounted value of the next state \\(\\color{blue}{\\gamma v_{\\pi}(s')}\\). We weight each of those values by its probability of occurring \\(\\color{orange}{\\pi (a \\vert s)}\\color{purple}{p(s', r \\vert s, a)}\\) (where \\(\\color{orange}{\\pi (a \\vert s)}\\) is the probability of taking action \\(a\\) when following policy \\(\\pi\\), and \\(\\color{purple}{p(s', r \\vert s, a)}\\) is the probability of reaching the next state \\(s'\\) and getting reward \\(r\\) given the current state \\(s\\) and action \\(a\\)) and sum over all weighted values to get the expected value of state \\(s\\). Put simply, the value of state \\(s\\) is equal to the expected reward plus the discounted value of the expected next state.\nThe optimal state-value function \\(v_*\\) is the state-value function with the highest value across all policies (or in other words, the largest expected return achievable by any policy):\n\\[v_*(s) = \\max_{\\pi} v_{\\pi}(s), \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}\\]\nSince \\(v_*\\) is shared by all optimal policies \\(\\pi_*\\), it can be expressed without referencing any specific policy:\n\\[v_*(s) = \\color{brown}{\\max_a} \\color{black}{\\sum_{s',r}} \\color{purple}{p(s', r \\vert s, a)} \\color{blue}{\\left[ r + \\gamma v_*(s') \\right]}\\]\nThis is called the Bellman optimality equation and expresses the simple fact that, when following an optimal policy, the value of a state must equal the expected return for the best action from that state. Let’s go over the math in detail again. To calculate the optimal value of the state \\(s\\) we look at every action \\(a\\) that is available in that state. For each of these actions we look at all possibilities for \\(s'\\) and \\(r\\), compute their value by adding \\(\\color{blue}{r}\\) and the discounted optimal value of the next state \\(\\color{blue}{\\gamma v_*(s')}\\), and weight by their probability of occurring \\(\\color{purple}{p(s', r \\vert s, a)}\\). Finally, to get the optimal value of \\(s\\), we just take the \\(\\color{brown}{\\max}\\) over all actions.\nGiven \\(v_*\\), it is easy to determine an optimal policy. In each state \\(s\\), there is at least one action that obtains the maximum in the Bellman optimality equation. Any policy that only chooses between these actions (that is, assigns zero probability to all other actions) is optimal. In other words, an optimal policy is greedy with respect to the optimal value function \\(v_*\\).\nIn principle, assuming we have perfect knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, we could solve the system of equations given by the Bellman optimality equation (which gives one equation for each state) to get an exact solution of the RL problem. In practice, however, we usually lack the computational power and/or memory capacity to do so (think of chess, for example), which is why in nontrivial problems we need to settle for approximations. Indeed, most RL algorithms involve estimating a value function: either the state-value function or the action-value function which is introduced in the next section.\n\n\nAction-value function\nAnalogous to the state-value function \\(v_{\\pi}\\), the action-value function \\(q_{\\pi}(s,a)\\) defines the value of taking action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\) under policy \\(\\pi\\) as the expected return when starting from \\(s\\), taking action \\(a\\), and thereafter following policy \\(\\pi\\):\n\\[q_{\\pi}(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ G_t \\middle| S_t = s, A_t = a \\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^k R_{t+k+1}\\ \\middle|\\ S_t = s, A_t = a \\right]\\]\nWhile state-value functions estimate how good it is for an agent to be in a given state, action-value functions estimate how good it is to take a given action in a given state. Evidently, an agent should take the actions with the highest action-values in order to maximize his expected return.\nAgain, we can express \\(q_{\\pi}(s,a)\\) recursively:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nq_{\\pi}(s,a) & = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ G_t \\vert S_t = S, A_t = a \\right]\\\\\n             & = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi} \\left[ R_{t+1} + \\gamma G_{t+1} \\vert S_t = S, A_t = a \\right]\\\\\n             & = \\sum_{s', r} \\color{purple}{p(s', r \\vert s, a)} \\color{blue}{\\left[r + \\gamma v_{\\pi}(s') \\right]} \\color{black}{,\\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S},\\ \\forall a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis gives us the Bellman equation for action values: for all state-action pairs we calculate the sum of the reward \\(\\color{blue}{r}\\) and the discounted value of the next state \\(\\color{blue}{\\gamma v_{\\pi}(s')}\\), and weight it by the probability \\(\\color{purple}{p(s',r \\vert s, a)}\\) of reward \\(r\\) and next state \\(s'\\) given state \\(s\\) and action \\(a\\) before summing up. Note that we don’t weight over actions since we only look at one specific action.\nThe optimal action-value function \\(q_*\\) is the action-value function with the highest action-values across all policies:\n\\[q_*(s,a) = \\max_{\\pi} q_{\\pi}(s,a), \\forall s \\in \\mathcal{S}, \\forall a \\in \\mathcal{A}(s)\\]\nSince \\(q_*\\), like \\(v_*\\), is shared by all optimal policies \\(\\pi_*\\), it can be expressed without reference to any specific policy:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nq_*(s,a) & = \\mathbb{E} \\left[R_{t+1} + \\gamma \\max_{a'} q_*(S_{t+1}, a')\\ \\middle|\\ S_t = s, A_t = a \\right]\\\\\n         & = \\sum_{s',r} \\color{purple}{p(s',r \\vert s, a)} \\color{darkgreen}{\\left[ r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} q_*(s',a') \\right]}\n\\end{align}\\]\nThis is the Bellman optimality equation for \\(q_*\\). To compute the optimal value of taking action \\(a\\) in state \\(s\\), we look at all possible pairs of the next state \\(s'\\) and reward \\(r\\), compute their values by summing the reward \\(\\color{darkgreen}{r}\\) and the discounted optimal value of the best action in the next state \\(s'\\) \\(\\color{darkgreen}{\\gamma \\max_{a'} q_*(s',a')}\\), weight by their respective probability \\(\\color{purple}{p(s',r \\vert s, a)}\\), and sum them up.\nGiven \\(q_*\\), it is even easier to determine an optimal policy. We don’t need to look ahead to possible next states, simply choosing any action that maximizes \\(q_*(s,a)\\) suffices.\nIt should be clear now why values (state-values and action-values) are essential for making and evaluating decisions, and why trying to efficiently estimate them plays an important role in most RL algorithms.\n\n\nThe RL Cycle\nLet’s summarize the interaction between the agent and the environment:\n\nThe agent observes the environment. If he gets a perfect representation of the environment, he knows the state \\(s\\) of the environment. If he receives only a partial representation, he has an observation \\(o\\) which depends on the true state \\(s\\).\nBased on the state or observation, the agent takes a specific action \\(a\\) as determined by his policy \\(\\pi\\). Ideally he chooses his action so that he maximizes the expected return \\(G\\).\nIn response to the action of the agent the environment transitions from the old state \\(s\\) to a new state \\(s'\\) (which can be equal to the old state) and provides a reward \\(r\\) to the agent. The set of the state, the action, the reward, and the new state is called an experience.\nThe agent tries to learn from this experience to make better decisions in the future.\n\nTypically, these interactions go on for several (possibly infinitely many) time steps, resulting in a so-called trajectory \\(S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, S_2, A_2, R_3, \\dots\\).\n\n\nConclusion: RL and MDPs\nThe MDP framework essentially reduces the RL problem of goal-directed learning from interaction to three signals which are passed from the agent to the environment or vice versa: the actions which represent the agent’s decisions, the states which inform the agent’s decision making, and the rewards which define the agent’s goal. While this is surely idealized, it allows us to model a broad range of sequential decision making problems and even proves to be useful in cases where the formal assumptions of the framework are not exactly met."

    "text": "Key Challenges in RL\nNow that we have introduced the MDP framework, we can look ahead at the major challenges we face when tackling RL problems:\n\nEvaluative feedback: Instead of instructive feedback which provides the correct action to take (think of supervised learning), an RL agent gets evaluative feedback by the environment. That is, the feedback signal only indicates the goodness but not the correctness of an action. To reach his goal, an agent has to learn good behavior by exploring the realm of possible actions, while also exploiting his current knowledge by taking the best action he is aware of. This gives rise to the exploitation vs. exploration trade-off which we’ll discuss in more depth in the next post.\nDelayed feedback: Rewards for actions may manifest only several time steps after the corresponding action was chosen by the agent. Thus, an agent has to correctly assign credit to actions even though they have delayed consequences. This is called the temporal credit assignment problem.\nSampled feedback: In stochastic tasks the reward provided by the environment is merely a sample. When the agent doesn’t have perfect knowledge of the MDP’s dynamics, he needs to find a way to get a reliable estimate of the reward he is going to receive."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Whether in academia or industry, research questions are often causal in nature. That is, we want to know whether a medical procedure caused patients to recover, whether a policy intervention caused some behavioral change in the population, whether a new store design caused an increase in sales, or whether a recently implemented feature caused an increase in customer retention. In practice, though, it is surprisingly common to avoid language that refers to causal concepts. A 2022 study by Haber et al. which examined over 1,000 articles published in high-profile medical and epidemiological journals found that even though few articles declared an explicit interest in estimating causal effects, a third of the studies issued action recommendations (implying that a causal mechanism has been found), and the majority of the studies used language that implied causality (e.g., “X affects Y”, “X is linked to Y”, “X is followed by Y”). What we end up with can be called “Schrödinger’s causal inference”: researchers caution against causal interpretations but still offer causal interpretations themselves. Why is that? Apparently, researchers intend to estimate causal effects but shy away from using the causal inference methods which would actually allow to make this intention explicit. One likely reason is that causal inference goes beyond the realm of traditional statistics, introducing additional assumptions as well as a more rigorous way of thinking about relationships between variables. We can make this more concrete by looking at an example of Simpson’s paradox that will shine a light on why pure statistics isn’t enough to establish causal effects."

    "text": "Simpson’s Paradox\nSuppose that until recently, no treatment had been available for some unnamed disease. However, two newly developed treatments, treatment \\(A\\) and treatment \\(B\\), have shown promise in clinical trials and since became available to medical professionals. While treatment \\(A\\) is a surgical procedure, treatment \\(B\\) is a small molecule drug that blocks a key protein involved in the disease process.\nOur task is to analyze the following table which shows the condition of the patient at the time the treatment was decided as well as the corresponding success rates and case counts. Note that, due to supply chain and production issues, treatment \\(B\\) is more scarce than treatment \\(A\\).\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Fictional treatment data showing Simpson’s paradox\n\n\nWe can see that treatment \\(B\\) had a better recovery rate than treatment \\(A\\) for patients with mild cases (91.3% vs 86.8%), as well as patients with severe cases (80.0% vs 71.4%). However, in the whole population, the patients who were treated with treatment \\(A\\) had a better recovery rate than the patients treated with treatment \\(B\\) (85.3% vs 81.4%). This is an example of Simpson’s paradox, a statistical phenomenon in which a statistical association that holds for an entire population is reversed in every subpopulation.\nIf we had to make the decision which treatment to recommend for a patient, how should we interpret the data? Should we recommend treatment \\(A\\) if we don’t know the condition of the patient and \\(B\\) if we do? That can’t be right; a patient has to be either a mild or a severe case even if we don’t know the condition and \\(B\\) apparently is superior for both conditions. So should we just rely on the segregated data because the success rates of the subpopulations provide more specific information or should we only consult the aggregated success rate because it is more general? In short, which is better: treatment \\(A\\) or treatment \\(B\\)?\nIt turns out that we cannot answer this question with pure statistics. Without knowing the causal structure of the data, we simply cannot tell whether we should prefer treatment \\(A\\) or treatment \\(B\\). To understand this key point, let’s consider two different scenarios.\nScenario 1: In scenario 1, the patient’s condition \\(C\\) is a cause of both the treatment \\(T\\) and the outcome \\(Y\\) (i.e., the recovery of the patient). This would be the case when doctors decide to reserve treatment \\(B\\) for patients with severe conditions (e.g., because it is more expensive or less invasive or both). Then, having a severe condition would cause patients to be less likely to recover (simply because of their condition) and more likely to receive treatment \\(B\\). It follows that treatment \\(B\\) will be associated with a lower success rate in the entire population just because the patient’s condition is a common cause of both the treatment and the outcome. We say that condition confounds the effect of treatment on recovery. We can correct for this confounding by analyzing the relationship of \\(T\\) and \\(Y\\) among patients with the same condition. In our example, this would mean that treatment \\(B\\) is the better treatment because it leads to a higher recovery rate in both subpopulations (i.e., the subpopulations with mild and severe cases, respectively). We can visualize the causal structure of this scenario with the following graph:\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Causal diagram of scenario 1\n\n\nScenario 2: In scenario 2, the prescription of treatment \\(T\\) is a cause of both the patient’s condition \\(C\\) and the outcome \\(Y\\). This would be the case, for example, when the supply chain issues of treatment \\(B\\) lead to a time delay between the prescription and the reception of the treatment, while treatment \\(A\\) can be applied instantaneously. If the severity of the disease worsens over time, this would mean that the assignment of treatment \\(B\\) can cause patients to transition from mild to severe cases of the disease, ultimately causing a lower recovery rate. In that case we could conclude that, even though treatment \\(B\\) might be more effective than treatment \\(A\\) once received by the patient, prescribing treatment \\(A\\) is overall more effective. The causal diagram highlights the difference to scenario 1:\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Causal diagram of scenario 2\n\n\nWhat should we make of this? Comparing both scenarios shows that, without knowing the story behind the data it is impossible to determine which treatment is better. It was only after considering the causal mechanisms generating the data that we were able to make a correct conclusion. Viewed that way, the apparent Simpson’s paradox isn’t actually a paradox; it merely shows impressively that making causal claims requires making causal assumptions."

    "text": "Association and Causation\nWhether you have engaged in some data analysis yourself or followed a heated discussion about the correct way to interpret some data on Twitter, you have likely heard of the mantra “correlation doesn’t imply causation.” To see what this means, let’s have a look at an example. As it turns out, the yearly number of non-commercial space launches has a high degree of correlation with the yearly number of sociology doctorates awarded in the United States.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Correlation of non-commercial space launches and sociology doctorates awarded in the US, courtesy of tylervigen.com\n\n\nWe can probably agree there are no causal relationships at play here, meaning that this is a spurious correlation. Many more examples like this, showcasing fun but meaningless correlations, can be found on Tyler Vigen’s very entertaining website spurious correlations.\nIt is actually relatively easy to stumble upon such spurious correlations. If you collect a large enough dataset (or generate one yourself with just random data) you will find correlations between some variables that are entirely due to chance. More importantly, however, correlation can be (and often is) caused by confounding variables (also called confounders or lurking variables). An example: You might find a positive correlation between ice cream sales and the number of shark attacks. It is safe to assume that this isn’t due to ice cream somehow attracting sharks or shark attacks causing people to console themselves with ice cream. Instead there is a confounding variable: temperature. Higher temperatures not only cause more people to enjoy some ice cream, they also cause more people to go for a swim in the ocean risking an unfortunate encounter with a shark. Thus, we say that the correlation between both variables is due to confounding.\nSince correlation is merely a measure of linear statistical dependence, it is better to use the term association when referring to statistical dependence in general. But what does it really mean when we say “association is not causation” or “association does not imply causation”? In essence, this means that the amount of association and the amount of causation between two variables can be different. It is possible that none of the association is causal (probably like in the example of space launches and sociology doctorates) and it is also possible that some or even all of the association is causal. This is what motivates the field of causal inference. With statistical tools alone it is not possible to determine the amount of causation hiding behind association. Instead we have to specifically address the causal mechanisms that are generating our data."

    "section": "Causal Inference in Data Science",
    "text": "Causal Inference in Data Science\nHaving established the need for causal inference, what is its role in the realm of data science? A useful mental model is to distinguish between three different tasks (Hernan, Hsu & Healy, 2019): description, prediction, and causal inference.\nDescriptive analysis is usually based on quantitative summaries of variables of interest and involves methods ranging from simple counts or proportions to sophisticated data visualizations or even more advanced techniques like unsupervised clustering. The goal is to describe the properties of some data, which, in and of itself, can help us understand aspects of the world that we are interested in. For example, a task that would be descriptive in nature is gathering the distribution of household heating sources by region. This might reveal patterns that can be used to inform policy decisions.\nPredictive modeling aims to generate accurate predictions of a variable (or some variables). In a prediction task, we only care about the predictive performance and generalization power of our model and will exploit any available variable that helps us in this regard. That is, we look for predictive information and not for causal information, which is why we should never assume that a given coefficient in a predictive model has a causal interpretation. A good example is the prediction of used car prices using features like age and mileage. The exact nature of the causal relationships at play here is not really relevant, we simply want to exploit all the information that is useful for our prediction task.\nFinally, causal inference aims to understand the impact of one variable, often called the treatment, on another variable, often called the outcome. That is, we want to find that part of the association between the treatment and the outcome that is causal in nature. For example, we might want to find the causal effect of air pollution on life expectancy or the causal effect of one-time bonus payments on employee retention. Thinking back to our example with Simpson’s paradox, the important point is that making valid causal inferences requires us to consider the causal mechanisms that generated our data.\nOf course, this is not to say that description, prediction, and causal inference are not related. They do, in fact, overlap in some respects: Descriptive analysis increases our understanding of the data no matter what we ultimately try to achieve and in some cases (i.e., if the causal structure of the data allows it) can actually be used to discern causal relationships. Also, while predictive models aren’t generally good causal models because they only care about predictive performance (which often goes hand in hand with introducing biases), some part of their predictive power stems from the causal relationships in the data. Causal models, on the other hand, do have some predictive power because the causal effect of the treatment tells us something about the outcome."

    "text": "Summary\nCausal inference is an essential tool for rigorous decision-making. Without addressing the causal structure of our data, we can only make associational claims – but what we actually often aspire to do is make causal claims. That is, we don’t merely want to know whether patients who got some treatment eventually got better, we want to know whether they got better because of the treatment. This is the purpose of causal inference.\nIn the following blog posts of this series we’ll discuss the topic in much more depth. We’ll go into how we can articulate causal assumptions, how we can build causal models and link them to our data, and how we can finally answer our causal questions in a wide range of different settings."

Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people.\n    Lead - Effective\n\n \n\n    At our school we should enforce that kids have to participate in community service at least twice a year.\n    Position - Adequate\n\n\n\n    Community service makes people feel better.\n    Claim - Ineffective\n\n \n\n    It is a very moving experience when you give food to someone who is hungry. It teaches you to be appreciative of what you have after you see someone who has nothing. It also makes you feel good inside. Having community service might change the attitude of some kids at your school.\n    Evidence - Effective\n\n\n\n    Some people think that community service is useless or a waste of time.\n    Counterclaim - Adequate\n\n \n\n    But in reality it only takes up a few days a year of an average persons life.\n    Rebuttal - Adequate\n\n \n\n    To only make the kids do two days of community service is no high price for anyone. It even doesn't take up the entire day, only a couple of hours.\n    Evidence - Adequate\n\n\n\n    Community service helps people, makes you feel better, and is not a humongous time consumer. Anyone who has some extra time should defiantly chose to do some. No one has a busy enough schedule do not be able to participate. As the principal of the school please require students to do community service.\n    Concluding Statement - Adequate\n\n\n\n\nNote that an essay doesn’t necessarily contain all discourse types:\n\n\nCode\nby_essay_id = train_df.groupby([\"essay_id\"]).discourse_type.value_counts().to_frame()\nby_essay_id.columns = [\"count_\"]\nby_essay_id.reset_index(drop=False, inplace=True)\nby_essay_id = by_essay_id.pivot(index=\"essay_id\", columns=\"discourse_type\").count_\nby_essay_id\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscourse_type\nClaim\nConcluding Statement\nCounterclaim\nEvidence\nLead\nPosition\nRebuttal\n\n\nessay_id\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n00066EA9880D\n3.0\n1.0\nNaN\n3.0\n1.0\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\n000E6DE9E817\n5.0\n1.0\n1.0\n3.0\nNaN\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\n0016926B079C\n7.0\nNaN\nNaN\n3.0\nNaN\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\n00203C45FC55\n1.0\n1.0\n3.0\n3.0\n1.0\n1.0\n3.0\n\n\n0029F4D19C3F\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n2.0\n1.0\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nFFA381E58FC6\n2.0\n1.0\nNaN\n1.0\nNaN\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\nFFC43F453EF6\n4.0\n1.0\n3.0\n1.0\nNaN\n1.0\n1.0\n\n\nFFD97A99CEBA\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n1.0\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\nFFF868E06176\n3.0\n1.0\nNaN\n3.0\n1.0\n1.0\nNaN\n\n\nFFFF80B8CC2F\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n1.0\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n4191 rows × 7 columns\n\n\n\nAlso, as it is usually the case with human-labeled datasets, the quality of the annotations can vary significantly between essays. While an essay on average contains almost 9 different discourse elements, there are quite a few essays with only one annotation that has been rated as a whole:\n\n\nCode\ndisplay_essay(\"AB02689C1A9B\")\n\n\n\n\n    In Germany, residetns have given up on cars. Vauban's streets are completely \"car-free\", except the main throughfare, where the tram to downtown Freiburg runs, and a few streets on one edge are only two places to park.\n\n70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and the 57 percent sold a car to move there. Some say they feel happier now than before when they had a car. Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle-class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced drastically. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the U.S.\n\nIn the new approach to make cities denser, and better for walking stores are being placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. In teh U.S., the Enviornmental Protection Agency is promoting \"car reduced\" communities, and legistors are starting to act, if cautiously. In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other tansport.\n\nAfter days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Almost 4,000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters, an international news agency headquartered in London; 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday.\n\nPresident Obama's goal to curb the U.S.'s greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week. Recent astudies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by. Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.\n    Evidence - Ineffective\n\n    \n\n\nFinally, the same discourse text can appear in different essays, belong to different discourse types, and have different effectiveness ratings:\n\n\nCode\nduplicates = train_df[train_df.discourse_text.duplicated(keep=False)].sort_values(by=\"discourse_text\")\nduplicates.head(25)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscourse_id\nessay_id\ndiscourse_text\ndiscourse_type\ndiscourse_effectiveness\n\n\n\n\n26691\n7f9c3500259d\nA602D45D22B2\n\"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an ...\nEvidence\nAdequate\n\n\n27350\nd628a6adda3a\nADB68BCD2874\n\"That's a lava dome that takes the form of an ...\nEvidence\nAdequate\n\n\n25391\n781452d9404c\n942ECB176B3A\nAt the most basic level, the electoral college...\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n28835\n6fa171a95540\nC2BAF4ADA2CA\nAt the most basic level, the electoral college...\nClaim\nAdequate\n\n\n28436\n9e12ec699196\nBB3A6C2D0B65\nBig States\nClaim\nAdequate\n\n\n20121\n35bf70c4a673\n4CA37D113612\nBig States\nClaim\nIneffective\n\n\n3933\nc5b2ecb3888e\n44E2726DA1B3\nI agree\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n11285\n5e4022e93247\nCB66B685DAF6\nI agree\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n17087\n99782ca26927\n2714214F7D9E\nI think students should be required to perform...\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n29590\n33d6bbba823c\nCE64FA08E4CF\nI think students should be required to perform...\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n15462\n8ae0dc965236\n0EAF5E712F0D\nI think we should keep the Electoral College\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n16552\n77f5379ee53b\n1ED8279252FB\nI think we should keep the Electoral College\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n15229\n6e9d3d79814a\n0B57654EDEC1\nI think we should keep the Electoral College\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n28669\na12f7822cf10\nC07E3C23CE7B\nI think we should keep the electoral college\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n19449\nf54814e5b814\n4478B3244F49\nI think we should keep the electoral college\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n20842\n34b98386dc46\n5729D5AE055C\nI would want to keep the Electoral College\nPosition\nEffective\n\n\n28406\n98154af4855d\nBACC53ECC1FB\nI would want to keep the Electoral College\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n7664\n912314d42f90\n8B19F3C51A0E\nIn \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the aut...\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n8072\n1a21c7fe68bb\n9224F001F074\nIn \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the aut...\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n17752\n3878c364f23d\n2E4AFCD3987F\nIn the ruels of voteing there should be change.\nConcluding Statement\nAdequate\n\n\n17743\na3b559b3a53d\n2E4AFCD3987F\nIn the ruels of voteing there should be change.\nPosition\nAdequate\n\n\n22657\n1e1b0be69df3\n6F896BABB13C\nOn the other hand the electoral college is a g...\nCounterclaim\nAdequate\n\n\n22652\n76af51544c15\n6F896BABB13C\nOn the other hand the electoral college is a g...\nCounterclaim\nAdequate\n\n\n11970\ncc0dad1234ec\nD8013F49DE51\nOpponents say that cell phones are good becaus...\nCounterclaim\nAdequate\n\n\n6570\ndee3f8aec4fc\n7742D58270C9\nOpponents say that cell phones are good becaus...\nCounterclaim\nIneffective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis indicates that context will matter a lot, i.e. the model will need the entire essay instead of the discourse text segment alone in order to make good predictions."

    "text": "The Model\nNow the question is, how can we frame the task so that it can be handled by a language model? Or, to be more precise, how can we design the input? One possible approach is defining the problem as text classification by doing something like this:\ndiscourse type: discourse text SEP essay text\nAlthough this may work relatively fine, there is a problem. This approach requires one forward pass for each discourse text in the dataset, and the context isn’t used as effectively as it could be. Thus, it was proposed to frame the problem as token classification instead of text classification. That is, we’ll use the entire essay and wrap each discourse text segment in corresponding CLS and END tokens (e.g., CLS_LEAD and END_LEAD). Apart from faster training, this approach will likely improve the model’s understanding of the context of each discourse segment. To compute the class scores we’ll only use the output of the classification head at the CLS tokens.\nLet’s see how this works out in code.\n\nTokenization\nLet’s begin by loading the full text for each essay and including it in our existing train_df dataframe.

Cars that will drive without a person actually behind the wheel controlling the actions of the vehicle. The idea of driverless cars going in to developement shows the amount of technological increase that the wolrd has made. The leader of this idea of driverless cars are the automobiles they call Google cars. The arduous task of creating safe driverless cars has not been fully mastered yet.[END_LEAD][CLS_POSITION] The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur.[END_POSITION] One thing that the article mentions is that[CLS_CLAIM] the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car.[END_CLAIM][CLS_EVIDENCE] This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so.[END_EVIDENCE][CLS_CLAIM] Another thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion.[END_CLAIM][CLS_EVIDENCE] Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery.[END_EVIDENCE] One last thing that the article mentions is negative about the developement of driverless cars is[CLS_CLAIM] who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect.[END_CLAIM][CLS_EVIDENCE] Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with.[END_EVIDENCE][CLS_CONCLUDING STATEMENT] With all these things that could possibly go wrong with these driverless cars there is no way that the developement of them should continue any further. In today's society if something bad COULD happen or something COULD go wrong, it WILL happen, and it WILL go wrong. There are just way too many safety hazards that come along with these driverless cars. Becuase of all of these problems that arise with the cars it is just a gargantuan risk to implement these cars into our lifestyles.[END_CONCLUDING STATEMENT][SEP]\"\n\n\nLooks good.\n\n\nFine-tuning DeBERTa\nSince models of the DeBERTa family are generally the best default choice in English language tasks, we’ll use the microsoft/deberta-v3-small checkpoint from the HuggingFace Hub and train it for three epochs.\nWhile we would normally employ a cross-validation scheme that validates on essay topics that the model hasn’t seen during training, we’ll stick to a very simple train test split for our demonstration purposes.\n\n\nCode\ndds = ds.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)\ndds\n\n\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['discourse_effectiveness', 'idxs', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask', 'labels'],\n        num_rows: 3352\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['discourse_effectiveness', 'idxs', 'input_ids', 'token_type_ids', 'attention_mask', 'labels'],\n        num_rows: 839\n    })\n})\n\n\n\n\nCode\nTRAINING_ARGS = {\n    \"learning_rate\": 9e-6,\n    \"num_train_epochs\": 3,\n    \"weight_decay\": 0.01,\n    \"warmup_ratio\": 0.1,\n    \"per_device_train_batch_size\": 4,\n    \"per_device_eval_batch_size\": 4,\n    \"fp16\": True,\n    \"optim\": \"adamw_torch\",\n    \"do_train\": True,\n    \"do_eval\": True,\n    \"logging_steps\": 50,\n    \"save_strategy\": \"epoch\",\n    \"evaluation_strategy\": \"epoch\",\n    \"save_total_limit\": 1,\n    \"group_by_length\": True,\n    \"save_total_limit\": 1,\n    \"metric_for_best_model\": \"loss\",\n    \"greater_is_better\": False,\n    \"gradient_checkpointing\": True,\n    \"gradient_accumulation_steps\": 1,\n    \"output_dir\": \"../output/\"\n}\n\n\n\n\nCode\nargs = TrainingArguments(**TRAINING_ARGS)\ndata_collator = DataCollatorForTokenClassification(tokenizer=tokenizer,\n                                                   pad_to_multiple_of=8,\n                                                   padding=True)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel_config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(MODEL_CKPT)\nmodel_config.update({\n    \"num_labels\": 3,\n    \"cls_tokens\": list(dtype2clstok.values()),\n    \"label2id\": label2id,\n    \"id2label\": {v: k for k, v in label2id.items()}\n})\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmodel = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(MODEL_CKPT, config=model_config)\n\n\nSince we added custom tokens, we have to resize the token embeddings:\n\n\nCode\nmodel.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))\n\n\nEmbedding(128015, 768)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntrainer = Trainer(model=model,\n                  args=args,\n                  train_dataset=dds[\"train\"],\n                  eval_dataset=dds[\"test\"],\n                  tokenizer=tokenizer,\n                  data_collator=data_collator)\n\n\nHaving set up the trainer, everything looks fine:\n\n\nCode\ntrainer.evaluate()\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [210/210 05:30]\n    \n    \n\n\n{'eval_loss': 1.0528874397277832,\n 'eval_runtime': 26.0332,\n 'eval_samples_per_second': 32.228,\n 'eval_steps_per_second': 8.067}\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntrainer.train()\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      [2514/2514 15:22, Epoch 3/3]\n    \n    \n\n\n\nEpoch\nTraining Loss\nValidation Loss\n\n\n\n\n1\n0.720800\n0.847753\n\n\n2\n0.714600\n0.703775\n\n\n3\n0.622000\n0.687999\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrainOutput(global_step=2514, training_loss=0.7359402344733263, metrics={'train_runtime': 924.097, 'train_samples_per_second': 10.882, 'train_steps_per_second': 2.72, 'total_flos': 1283172806215872.0, 'train_loss': 0.7359402344733263, 'epoch': 3.0})\n\n\nAnd that’s it!
