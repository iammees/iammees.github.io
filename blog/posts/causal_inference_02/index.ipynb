    "After motivating causal thinking in the first post of this series, we are ready to introduce some concepts and terminology that will not only allow us to reason about causality in a formal manner but will also help us get a more precise understanding of the key ideas and challenges of causal inference. We'll begin with the **potential outcomes framework**, also known as the **Neyman-Rubin causal model** because its notation was first introduced by Neyman in the 1920s (Neyman, 1923, translated and reprinted in [Splawa-Neyman, 1990](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2245382)) in the context of randomized experiments and later extended into a general framework by Rubin ([1974](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0037350))."

    "## Potential outcomes and the individual treatment effect\n",
    "\n",
    "In the potential outcomes framework, a causal effect is defined as a comparison between two states of the world. We'll illustrate this with an example. Imagine that you have to study for an important and challenging test. You decide to try a new learning technique that you haven't used before (e.g., [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition)) and ultimately pass the test. Did the new learning technique *cause* you to pass the test? This depends on what would have happened in the alternative reality where you didn't try out the new technique and stuck to your old ways of doing things. If you had also passed the test, there wasn't a causal effect (on the outcome of passing or failing the test); but if you would have failed the test, there indeed was a causal effect. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple example, we introduced the concept of **potential outcomes**. Potential outcomes exist only ex ante; they are a set of possibilities that can *potentially* be observed. Ultimately though, there will only be one **observed outcome**, and, since we cannot peak into alternative realities, we won't know anything about the **counterfactual outcomes** (i.e., the outcomes that didn't actually materialize).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce some notation and define these terms more formally. The potential outcome $Y_i(t)$ denotes the outcome of individual $i$ when getting treatment $t$. (Note: Instead of \"individual\" you'll often see the term \"unit\" since the objects of study aren't always people.) In our example, $Y(1)$ would denote the outcome (i.e., if you pass or fail the test) if you tried the new learning technique ($T=1$), and $Y(0)$ would denote the outcome if you kept learning like before ($T=0$). If the new technique actually causes you to pass the test, then $Y(1) = 1$ and $Y(0) = 0$. In contrast, if you would have passed the test anyway (i.e., no matter how you learned), $Y(1)=1$ and $Y(0)=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define the **individual treatment effect** (**ITE**, also known as the individual causal effect, the unit-level causal effect, or the unit-level treatment effect) for individual $i$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads us to what is known as the **fundamental problem of causal inference**. As we noted above, it is impossible to observe all potential outcomes for a given individual. Whereas potential outcomes are hypothetical random variables, there will only be one observed outcome (also called the actual or empirical outcome). That is, we cannot observe both $Y_1(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ and therefore cannot observe the ITE. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We'll generally use $T$ to denote the random variable for the treatment, $Y$ to denote the random variable for the outcome, and $X$ to denote covariates. We'll also follow the convention of uppercase letters denoting random variables and lowercase letters denoting values that random variables take on.\n",
    "- Here, we assume that $T$, the random variable for the treatment, is binary. In general though, $T$ can take on more than two values or be continuous.\n",
    "- While $Y(t)$ (note the missing subscript) is a random variable because different units have different potential outcomes, $Y_i(t)$ is usually thought of as being deterministic.\n",
    "- The potential outcomes that we cannot observe (because they only materialize in an alternative reality) are often called **counterfactuals**, whereas the actually observed outcome is sometimes referred to as a **factual**. It is important to note, however, that we can only speak of counterfactuals and factuals when an outcome has been observed. If there is not yet an observed outcome, there are only *potential* outcomes. "

For example, imagine that we are studying the effectiveness of a new exercise program for weight loss and recruit the participants of our study by advertising in a fitness magazine. It is virtually guaranteed that this scheme suffers from selection bias, because people who read fitness magazines are more likely to be motivated to get fit than people who do not read fitness magazines.

    "For the assumption of conditional exchangeability to hold, we have to introduce another important assumption. Just consider what would happen if we condition on $X$ but one of the resulting subgroups doesn't receive the treatment *at all*? We would condition on an event with zero probability and therefore couldn't assume unconfoundedness. Thus, **positivity** is the assumption that for all values of covariates $x$ present in the population of interest (i.e., $x$ such that $P(X=x)>0$) we have\n",

    "This is also known as **overlap** (because we need the covariate distribution of the treatment group to overlap with the covariate distribution of the control group) and **common support** (because we need $P(X \\vert T=1)$ to have the same support as $P(X \\vert T=0)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, a violation of the positivity assumption means that in some subgroup of the data either everyone receives the treatment or everyone receives the control. Hence, within this subgroup it is simply impossible to estimate the causal effect of treatment vs. control. In terms of our earlier example, just imagine what would happen if none of the students with low motivation had received the treatment (i.e., studied for twenty hours). In this subgroup, we wouldn't be able to compare the test scores of the treatment group with the test scores of the control group because there is only one, the treatment group. Hence, we wouldn't be able to estimate the causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "What follows is that there is a tradeoff between unconfoundedness and positivity. The more we increase the dimension of the covariates (i.e., by conditioning on more covariates), the smaller the subgroups become for any level $x$ of the covariates. The smaller a subgroup, the higher the chance that it only contains units that have received the treatment or units that have received the control. Finally, if the size of any subgroup has decreased to one, the violation of the positivity assumption is guaranteed. In regions where $P(T=1, X=x)=0$ or $P(T=0, X=x)=0$ our model will be forced to extrapolate which can lead to very bad results."

In general, it will be basically impossible to eliminate violations of the no interference assumption in data with network effects."

    "Our whirlwind tour of the potential outcomes framework has come to an end. We've learned that we can define a causal effect as a comparison between two states of the world. In the first state, an individual receives a treatment; in the second state, the individual doesn't receive the treatment. Then, the causal effect of the treatment is equal to the difference in outcomes between these two states of the world. We've used this logic to formally define different types of causal effects, but also had to face the fundamental problem of causal inference: while there exists a set of *potential* outcomes ex ante, we can only observe the *actual* outcome and will never know about the *counterfactual* outcome(s). This is why we can only *estimate* causal effects. To this end, we introduced several assumptions. The independence assumption states that the treatment has to be assigned independent of the potential outcomes. This can be achieved by randomizing the assignment of the treatment to the units. Another way is to use the conditional independence assumption which allows to estimate causal effects by adjusting for other variables. Finally, we briefly discussed the positivity assumption (in every subgroup of the data there have to be units that receive the treatment and units that receive the control), the no interference assumption (the outcome of unit $i$ has to be unaffected by the outcome of other units), and the consistency assumption (there should be no multiple versions of the treatment).\n",

    "In the next post, we will introduce another framework that uses causal graphs to offer a different perspective on causal inference. Mathematically, though, it is equivalent to the potential outcomes framework."
