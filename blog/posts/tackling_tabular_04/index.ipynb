Their rule-based approach is ideally suited for the typical irregular patterns of tabular data, and with a large enough dataset overfitting can be prevented. Also, GBDTs (especially XGBoost) nowadays profit heavily from GPU acceleration. If the data comes from physical processes or simulations, however, neural networks will often shine since they are biased towards smooth solutions. This also holds when interpolation is very important (e.g., because the samples are quite far from each other) because the piecewise constant functions learned by tree-based models are not suited for interpolation. Furthermore, neural networks are the way to go for representation learning. Finally, if we need the best possible predictive performance, deep learning usually works well as a complement to tree-based models in ensembles. Have a look at this recent [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08815.pdf) for more on tree-based models and neural networks for tabular data.\n","- For huge datasets (with, say, more than a billion observations), neural networks are typically the best choice.

Nowadays, it is primarily developed by Nvidia leading to built-in GPU acceleration which massively speeds up model training.\n","\n","Let's have a look at the most important hyperparameters:\n","\n","- `n_estimators`: This is the number of trees fitted (which is equal to the number of boosting iterations). Generally a higher number of trees improves the model's performance (at least up to some point), but also increases the risk of overfitting. In general, around `1,000` trees should be enough; using many more is not needed in most problem settings (`5,000` should definitely be enough). Important: `n_estimators` has to be tuned in conjunction with the `learning_rate`. Thus, a good approach can be to set `n_estimators=1000` and try out different learning rates (or do a grid search) before proceeding with tuning other hyperparameters. After finding a good hyperparameter setting, we can still tune both the number of trees and the learning rate. (Note that this can be done the other way around, too. That is, we can set the learning rate so that around 1,000 trees are used, and continue from there.)\n","- `learning_rate`: A learning rate between `0.001` and `0.1` should work fine. Generally, a lower learning rate should be combined with a higher number of trees.\n","- `max_depth`: Apart from `n_estimators` and `learning_rate`, `max_depth` is probably the most important hyperparameter. It determines the maximum depth of the trees; with a higher `max_depth` the model becomes more complex but also more likely to overfit. When tuning by hand, this is the first hyperparameter (after the number of trees/learning rate) that should be tuned. It is also the first parameter to decrease if overfitting is a problem. In general, a value between `3` and `10` should be fine. Depending on the problem, it can make sense to go a bit higher. Note that a higher `max_depth` results in slower computation and higher memory usage.\n","- `min_child_weight`: Technically, `min_child_weight` is the minimum sum of instance weight needed in a child. In lay terms it regularizes the model by limiting the depth of the trees. Generally, a higher `min_child_weight` means a more conservative model. A good range for tuning is between `1` (the default value) and `300`.\n","- `colsample_bytree`: This is the subsample ratio of columns when constructing each tree. Subsampling columns when constructing each tree can make the training faster and more robust to noise. Typically, the best value is between `0.5` and `0.9` (or even `0.3` and `1.0`).\n","- `subsample`: This is the subsample ratio of the training instances (subsampling occurs once in every boosting iteration). Like `colsample_bytree`, using `subsample` helps prevent overfitting by introducing randomness in the training process. Typically, the best value is between `0.5` and `0.8` (or even `0.4` and `1.0`). `0.7` is often a good starting point. Making use of `colsample_bytree` and `subsample` leads to more different tree splits.\n","- `reg_alpha`, `reg_lambda`: While `alpha` represents the L1 regularization term on weights, `lambda` is the L2 regularization term. Increasing these hyperparameters translates to making the model more conservative. There are two things to note: First, adding regularization is not always better. Second, for GBDTs it tends to be better to set `alpha` to (near) zero, while using a higher `lambda`. A good range for tuning is between `0.001` and `10.0`.\n","- `max_bin`: The maximum number of bins to bucket numerical features. The default is `256`. Can be increased to build a more complex model, but comes with a higher risk of overfitting and slows down training.\n","- `gamma`: `gamma` represents the minimum loss reduction required to make a further partition on a leaf node of the tree. That is, gamma controls the complexity of the model and can be increased to combat overfitting. Since a good value for gamma is highly dependent on the data set and the other hyperparameters, it is difficult to give a good range for tuning. As per this [post](https://medium.com/data-design/xgboost-hi-im-gamma-what-can-i-do-for-you-and-the-tuning-of-regularization-a42ea17e6ab6), it can help to increase `gamma` (the default is `0`; try `3`, `5`, or `10`, for example) if overfitting appears to be a huge problem. Values around 20 should only be used when the model uses a high `max_depth`.\n","\n","Apart from `n_estimators` and `learning_rate`, it is typically enough to tune `max_depth`, `min_child_weight`, `colsample_bytree`, `subsample`, and `reg_alpha`/`reg_lambda`.\n","\n","Notes:\n","\n","- The XGBoost library provides two APIs: its original \"Learning API\" and a scikit-learn wrapper interface, the \"Scikit-Learn API\".

The automatic hyperparameter optimization methods that are briefly outlined below can generally be applied to any problems or models, not just tabular ones. Note: Before we can optimize hyperparameters, we of course need a model, a hyperparameter search space (i.e., a range of values for each hyperparameter), and a reliable CV scheme with an evaluation metric that we care about.\n","\n","- **Grid search**: Grid search translates to searching exhaustively through all possible hyperparameter combinations. The algorithm is highly parallelizable, but naturally suffers from the curse of dimensionality and is therefore not feasible in a high-dimensional search space. We can use it in the rare cases that don't require a lot of tuning, though. Grid search is implemented by scikit-learn's [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV).\n","- **Random search**: Instead of trying every combinations, random search randomly samples the search space. Since this is generally feasible in high-dimensional spaces, doesn't waste time with testing slightly different combinations, and still has a good chance of finding a good set of hyperparameters, random search is quite common in practice. It is implemented in scikit-learn's [`RandomizedSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV).\n","- **Halving search**: Both grid search and random search cannot recognize ineffective hyperparameters or search intervals. To remedy this, scikit-learn also provides hyperparameter optimization based on [successive halving](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV) (SH). In the first iteration, the SH algorithm evaluates all parameter combinations with a small amount of resources (often the number of training samples). Then, it selects only the best candidates for the next iteration which in turn uses more resources for evaluation. This process continues in the following iterations (i.e., only a subset of candidates proceeds to the next round and the corresponding performance estimates get more precise since more resources are allocated for evaluation). Scikit-learn implements the SH algorithm in [`HalvingGridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.HalvingGridSearchCV) and [`HalvingRandomSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.HalvingRandomSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.HalvingRandomSearchCV). \n","- **Bayesian optimization**: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a more sophisticated approach. Unlike grid search or random search, BO optimizes a surrogate function instead of the true objective function (because the true objective function may be expensive to evaluate, noisy, and evaluation doen't give gradient information). In the beginning BO focuses on exploration to train the surrogate function, and then starts to exploit its approximate knowledge of the objective to sample more useful examples (i.e., hyperparameter combinations). For smooth search spaces, BO is typically based on Gaussian processes (with [scikit-optimize](https://github.com/scikit-optimize/scikit-optimize) being the most prominent example). An alternative for more complex search spaces are Tree Parzen Estimators (TPEs) which sample parameter combinations from a multivariate probability distribution. TPE is the default sampler used by [Optuna](https://github.com/optuna/optuna), a widely used tool for hyperparameter optimization. See [here](https://distill.pub/2020/bayesian-optimization/) for a nice and more in-depth explanation of Bayesian optimization.\n","\n","Finally, some general tips for GBDT hyperparameter tuning:\n","\n","- Focus on key hyperparameters. It isn't necessary to tune all available hyperparameters; instead focus on key hyperparameters that can be tuned intuitively.\n","- Stay conservative. Using huge search spaces for finding the best possible hyperparameter configuration usually results in overfitting to the validation data. Thus, blindly trusting the result of an Optuna study is generally not a good idea (we need to at least check the best trials for consistency).\n","- Don't tune the hyperparameters too often. After the hyperparameters of a model have been tuned, the results cannot be reliably compared to older runs. Tune the hyperparameters of the model when the feature engineering is complete (and maybe once when a useful basic set of features has been created). \n","- Don't use early stopping. Instead of using a different number of trees for each fold (inevitably leading to overfitting), select the number of trees that works best across folds. We generally wouldn't use different hyperparameters for our folds; this applies to the number of trees too. Also, using early stopping complicates retraining on the full dataset.\n","- With some experience, tuning GBDTs manually can be a quite intuitive method for hyperparameter optimization (and get better results in less trials than Optuna). An example for XGBoost: Set `n_estimators=1000` and choose an adequate learning rate. Then, try some reasonable values for `max_depth` and plot the corresponding CV scores (we should be able to see whether we need to try more values). Proceed like this with `min_child_weight`, `colsample_bytree`, `subsample`, and `reg_alpha`/`reg_lambda`. This way, we'll gather a better understanding of the role of each hyperparameter.
